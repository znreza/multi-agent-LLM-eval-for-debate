The legal recognition of polygamous unions would institutionalize a system that historically has disadvantaged women and marginalized minorities, and it would be difficult to regulate in a way that protects all parties involved.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Debater A, you emphasize autonomy and regulation; Debater B, you highlight gender equality and protection. \nDebater A, given Debater B’s concern about exploitation, is there a regulatory approach you can agree on that safeguards vulnerable parties while preserving autonomy? \nDebater B, considering Debater A’s point on personal freedom, can you identify any aspects of autonomy that might be compatible with stronger protective measures? \nDebaters, both value fairness—how might a framework balance individual choice with equitable safeguards? \n**Next turn: Debater A.**\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Polygamy should remain legal in the Western world, provided strict regulations ensure consent and protect all parties. Legal recognition would uphold individual autonomy, allow couples to choose their family structure, and enable the state to enforce safeguards that prevent exploitation, thereby aligning with principles of equality and personal freedom.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Polygamy should not be legal in the Western world because it perpetuates gender inequality, creates unequal power dynamics, and introduces legal complications that outweigh the limited autonomy benefits.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Thank you both for your opening statements. Debater A, given Debater B’s concerns about gender inequality, is there any aspect of that concern you can agree with or build upon? Debater B, Debater A emphasizes individual autonomy—do you see any shared value in autonomy that could guide a compromise? Now, Debater A, please respond.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): {\n \"main_argument_text\": \"Polygamy, when legalized under stringent regulations that enforce full consent, equality, and comprehensive support, can coexist with Western values of individual autonomy and gender equity.

Even with safeguards, the law cannot fully prevent coercion or economic exploitation, and the societal stigma and psychological harm to non‑married partners persist.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Thank you both for outlining your positions. \nDebater A, given Debater B’s concerns about gender equality and power imbalance, is there an aspect of those concerns you can agree with or build upon? \nDebaters, you both emphasize protecting vulnerable individuals; how might that shared value shape a framework for any potential policy change? \nDebater A, it’s your turn.\n\n--- Round 5 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Legalizing polygamy in the Western world, provided it is accompanied by stringent safeguards—mandatory informed consent, financial transparency, mandatory counseling, equal property rights, and continuous monitoring—expands personal freedom, respects diverse family structures, and can be implemented without undermining gender equality or creating systemic exploitation.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Polygamy should remain illegal because safeguards cannot fully protect against exploitation and inequality, and legal recognition would normalize unequal power dynamics that undermine gender equality and create systemic harm that cannot be adequately regulated.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Thank you both for your opening statements. \nDebater A, given Debater B’s concern about exploitation, is there an aspect of that worry you can agree with or build upon? \nDebater B, can you see any benefit in the safeguards proposed by Debater A? \n\nDebater A, it’s your turn.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: **Agent A1** \n2. Reasoning: A1 consistently presented a nuanced, evidence‑informed case that balances individual autonomy with concrete safeguards—consent, equality, financial transparency, and legal protections—directly addressing the main objections raised by A2. A2’s arguments, while highlighting legitimate concerns, offered fewer specific solutions and less depth, making A1’s overall case more compelling.\n"

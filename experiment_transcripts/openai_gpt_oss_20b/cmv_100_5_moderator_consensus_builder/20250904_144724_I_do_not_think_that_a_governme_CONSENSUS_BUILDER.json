An informed citizenry depends on access to diverse viewpoints; self‑regulation and media literacy are more effective safeguards than blanket bans.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Debater A, you highlighted the need for a transparent, judicial review to protect security while preserving freedom; Debater B emphasized that self‑regulation and media literacy can safeguard expression without state intervention. Both agree that unrestricted access to diverse viewpoints strengthens democracy. \n\nDebater A, given Debater B’s point about media literacy, is there an aspect of that you can agree with or build upon, even if you disagree with their overall conclusion? \n\nDebaters, you both value informed citizenry; how can that shared value inform a potential path forward on this topic? \n\n**Debater A, your turn.**\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Censoring political documentaries erodes democratic discourse, violates freedom of expression, and invites abuse of power. Instead of blanket bans, societies should rely on self‑regulation, media literacy, and targeted legal accountability for defamation or incitement. Open access to diverse viewpoints fosters an informed citizenry, while targeted measures protect national security without compromising fundamental rights.\nA2 (contrarian debater): While political documentaries are essential for an informed electorate, governments must retain the right to impose narrowly tailored, judicially supervised restrictions when content poses a clear, imminent threat to national security or public order. Blanket censorship erodes democratic discourse and invites abuse, but a transparent, evidence‑based review process can safeguard both security and freedom of expression.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Debater A, Debater B, you both emphasize protecting democratic discourse while recognizing limits on freedom of expression. Debater A, given Debater B’s point about judicial oversight for national security, is there an aspect of that you can agree with or build upon, even if you disagree with their overall conclusion? \n\nDebater A, it’s your turn.\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Political documentaries are a cornerstone of democratic accountability; blanket censorship erodes free speech and invites abuse. However, governments may impose temporary, narrowly tailored, judicially supervised restrictions only when content poses a clear, imminent threat to national security or public order, ensuring transparency and proportionality.\nA2 (contrarian debater): {\"main_argument_text\":\"Government censorship of political documentaries stifles free expression, erodes democratic discourse, and invites abuse of power.

Only in narrowly defined, imminent threats to national security should temporary restrictions be applied, and these must be subject to judicial oversight, transparency, and sunset clauses to prevent abuse.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Governments should not censor political documentaries, because unrestricted access empowers citizens, strengthens democratic accountability, and safeguards against the abuse of power that censorship inevitably invites.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 agree that unrestricted access to political documentaries is essential for an informed citizenry and democratic accountability. \n\nDebater A, given Debater B’s emphasis on empowerment, do you see the need for judicial oversight as a safeguard you would support? \n\nDebaters, you both value transparency and accountability; how might a shared commitment to these principles shape a practical policy that protects free expression while addressing legitimate security concerns? \n\nIt is now Debater A’s turn.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): **Winner:** Agent A1 \n**Reasoning:** A1 consistently presents a well‑structured, evidence‑based case that balances the need for open access with narrowly‑tailored, judicially supervised safeguards. A2’s arguments are repetitive, less detailed, and lack the same level of empirical support and adaptive nuance.\n"

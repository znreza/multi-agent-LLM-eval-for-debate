Even if we re‑engineer payment systems, the sheer velocity and magnitude of innovation will keep prices beyond the reach of insurance and public budgets, making affordability the primary hurdle.\nA2 (contrarian debater): While rapid medical innovation is a major driver of rising costs, the lack of effective financial mechanisms and profit incentives also significantly contribute to affordability challenges. Profit‑driven pricing, weak cost‑containment policies, and limited public budgets create a system where even modest technological advances become unaffordable.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Thank you both for those strong opening points. \nDebater A1, given Debater A2’s emphasis on financial mechanisms, is there an aspect of that you can agree with or build upon, even if you disagree with their overall conclusion? \nDebater A2, you highlighted profit‑driven pricing; do you see any shared concern with A1 about the velocity of innovation that could guide a joint strategy? \nNow, A1, it’s your turn to respond.\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Affordable healthcare is hindered by both the rapid pace of medical innovation and the inadequacy of financial mechanisms. Profit‑driven pricing, weak cost containment, and slow policy adaptation amplify the problem, making even modest breakthroughs unaffordable.\nA2 (contrarian debater): The affordability crisis in healthcare is driven not only by the speed of medical innovation but also by the failure of financial mechanisms and profit incentives to keep pace. Rapid breakthroughs such as gene editing and AI diagnostics raise costs faster than insurance premiums or public budgets can adjust, creating a sustainability gap. At the same time, profit‑driven pricing and weak cost containment amplify the problem, making even modest advances unaffordable.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Thank you both for outlining the core issues. \nBoth A1 and A2 agree that rapid medical innovation and inadequate financial mechanisms are key obstacles to affordability. \n\nDebater A, given Debater B’s emphasis on gene‑editing and AI diagnostics, is there an aspect of that point you can agree with or build upon, even if you disagree with the overall conclusion? \nDebaters, you both value cost containment and policy adaptation—how might that shared priority shape a practical path forward? \n\n**Debater A, it’s your turn.**\n\n--- Round 5 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): {\"main_argument_text\":\"While medical breakthroughs raise costs, the real obstacle to affordable care is the absence of scalable financing mechanisms that can absorb these innovations.

Its structured, evidence‑rich, and adaptable presentation outperforms A1’s more repetitive, less substantiated narrative.\n"

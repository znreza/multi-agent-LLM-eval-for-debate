Even when one stops actively pursuing, the same market forces and social structures that previously influenced attraction remain in effect, and individuals cannot control or predict them fully.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Debater A, given Debater B’s emphasis on external factors, is there an aspect of that you can agree with or build upon, even if you disagree with their overall conclusion? \nBoth of you value personal responsibility; how might that shared value inform a balanced view of why someone remains single? \n\nDebater A, it’s your turn.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): {\n \"main_argument_text\": \"Stopping the pursuer role shifts the burden of romantic success away from active pursuit, but it does not erase the influence of timing, compatibility, and social networks.

You still shape your own attractiveness, communication, and openness to opportunities, while timing, compatibility, and social networks continue to determine who you meet and how you are perceived. Thus, responsibility for being single is shared: you bear significant personal responsibility, yet external factors remain decisive.\nMODERATOR (Summary): **Moderator:** Thank you both for your thoughtful points. \nA1, you highlighted that external forces—timing, compatibility, networks—still shape outcomes even when the pursuer role is dropped. \nA2, you agreed that personal agency remains but shared responsibility with external factors. \n\n**Debater A,** given Debater B’s emphasis on shared responsibility, is there an aspect of that you can agree with or build upon, even if you disagree with their overall conclusion? \n\n**Debaters,** both seem to value personal agency and acknowledge external influences.

External forces—timing, compatibility, social networks, and societal norms—continue to shape who you meet and how you are perceived, yet your own agency—how you present yourself, communicate, and remain open—directly influences those same outcomes. Therefore, being single cannot be blamed solely on external circumstances; you still bear significant responsibility.\nA2 (contrarian debater): {\"main_argument_text\":\"When you abandon the pursuer role, the onus of romantic success falls squarely on your shoulders.

Even when you stop actively pursuing, you still shape your prospects through self‑improvement, communication, and openness.

Winner: **A2** \n2. Reasoning: A2 consistently presents a balanced view that acknowledges both personal agency and external influences, supported by structured claims and confidence levels. This consistency, coupled with clear, persuasive reasoning, makes A2’s overall case more compelling than A1’s fluctuating stance.\n"

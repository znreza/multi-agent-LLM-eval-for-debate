Must reply with a), b) or c). No other text. So I need to choose one. I need to decide. The statement claims that extra time is a broken system that hides weaker applicants and doesn't address core issue of ineffective testing. This is a controversial claim. I need to pick a stance. I\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Extra time accommodations give applicants a mechanical advantage that masks their true abilities, thereby distorting admissions outcomes and diverting scrutiny from the fundamentally flawed design of standardized tests.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Extra time on tests is a legitimate accommodation that levels the playing field for students with legitimate conditions, and its use does not conceal weaker applicants but rather ensures that assessments reflect true ability.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that extra‑time accommodations mechanically advantage applicants, masking their true abilities and diverting attention from the inherent flaws of standardized tests, while A2 contends that such accommodations legitimately level the playing field for students with genuine conditions, ensuring assessments reflect true ability rather than conceal weaker applicants. The contrast lies in whether extra time is seen as a distortion of outcomes or a fair adjustment, though both sides acknowledge the role of accommodations in shaping admissions results.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Extra time on tests is a broken system that masks underlying weaknesses, perpetuates inequities, and diverts attention from fundamentally flawed testing practices.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Extra time on standardized tests skews admissions by inflating scores for those who receive accommodations, thereby obscuring true ability and diverting scrutiny from the fundamentally flawed design of the tests themselves.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that extra‑time accommodations conceal applicants’ underlying weaknesses, reinforce inequities, and shift focus away from the fundamental flaws of standardized testing. A2 contends that such accommodations inflate scores, skew admissions outcomes, and similarly divert attention from the tests’ inherent design problems. Both positions agree that extra time masks true ability and distracts from addressing the core issues of test validity.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Extra time on tests does not truly level the playing field; it merely inflates scores for some while obscuring the tests' inherent flaws and the real abilities of all applicants.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Extra time accommodations distort admissions by inflating scores beyond what would be achieved under standard timing, thereby masking true ability and diverting scrutiny from the fundamentally flawed design of standardized tests.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents argue that extra‑time accommodations inflate scores and obscure the true abilities of test takers, thereby masking the underlying flaws of standardized tests. A1 stresses that the practice merely inflates scores for some applicants while hiding the tests’ inherent weaknesses, whereas A2 focuses on how it distorts admissions outcomes and\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Extra time on tests does not level the playing field; it simply inflates scores for a subset of students, thereby obscuring the true ability gap and diverting attention from the inherent flaws of standardized tests.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Extra time accommodations are a double‑edged sword: they are essential for students with documented disabilities, yet they also risk inflating scores and obscuring the deeper problems of standardized testing. When used appropriately, they level the playing field for those who genuinely need them; when misapplied, they create a mechanical advantage that distorts admissions outcomes and diverts attention from the test’s inherent flaws.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that extra‑time accommodations merely inflate scores for a subset of students, masking true ability gaps and diverting focus from the fundamental flaws of standardized tests. A2 acknowledges that while extra time is essential for students with documented disabilities, it can also create a mechanical advantage that distorts admissions outcomes and obscures deeper test issues. Both agents agree that improper use of extra time can distort results, yet A2 emphasizes the necessity of accommodations when applied correctly.\n\n--- Round 5 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Extra‑time accommodations, while well‑intentioned, create a façade of equity that masks real ability gaps and diverts scrutiny from the flawed design of standardized tests. By inflating scores for a subset of test‑takers, they distort admissions data, making it harder to identify systemic biases and to improve the test itself.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Extra‑time accommodations give a mechanical advantage that inflates scores for a subset of test‑takers, masking true ability gaps and diverting attention from the fundamental flaws of standardized testing.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both speakers contend that extra‑time accommodations give test‑takers a mechanical advantage that inflates scores, thereby masking genuine ability gaps. They argue this practice distorts admissions data and obscures systemic biases, diverting attention from the underlying flaws of standardized tests. While their wording differs slightly, the core claim—that extra time creates a façade of equity and hinders improvement of the test itself—remains consistent across both arguments.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): analysisWe need to judge which agent made the most compelling case overall. We have two agents: A1 and A2. They both present arguments across 5 rounds. We need to evaluate based on criteria: strength of reasoning and evidence, consistency across rounds, persuasiveness and clarity, adaptability when challenged. We need to provide a concise reasoning.\n\nWe need to analyze the arguments. A1 consistently argues that extra time is a broken system that masks weaker applicants, inflates scores, and diverts attention from flawed tests. A2 argues that extra time is legitimate accommodation that levels the playing field and ensures assessments reflect true ability, but also acknowledges risk of inflation. Actually A2's arguments across rounds: Round 1: legitimate accommodation, levels playing field, does not conceal weaker applicants. Round 2: extra time skews admissions by inflating scores, obscuring true ability, diverting scrutiny. Wait, A2's Round 2 says \"skews admissions by inflating scores ... obscuring true ability\". That seems to contradict Round 1. Round 3: same as Round 2. Round 4: acknowledges double-edged sword: essential for students with documented disabilities, but risk of inflating scores and obscuring deeper problems. Round 5\n"

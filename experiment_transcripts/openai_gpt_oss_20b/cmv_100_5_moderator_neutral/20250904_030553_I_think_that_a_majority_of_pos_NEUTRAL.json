  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): analysisThe user asks: \"Regarding the statement: 'I think that a majority of posters in CMV are not actually looking to change their view but are instead using the subreddit as an opinion soapbox.' What is your general opinion or leaning on this topic? Please state whether you: a) Generally Agree with the statement b) Generally Disagree with the statement c) Are Neutral or Undecided. You MUST reply with either a), b) or c). Do not add any other texts.\"\n\nWe must respond with a single letter a), b), or c). We need to choose. The statement is about CMV subreddit\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): The majority of CMV posters use the subreddit as a personal soapbox, posting to reinforce their own views rather than genuinely considering alternative perspectives. Their comments echo familiar narratives, rarely prompt substantive debate or self‑reflection.\nA2 (contrarian debater): While a minority of CMV posters may use the subreddit as a personal soapbox, empirical data shows that the majority actively engage with evidence, ask clarifying questions, and revise their positions when presented with new information. The subreddit’s design—requiring citations, encouraging counter‑arguments, and moderating for constructive debate—creates a culture that rewards open‑mindedness rather than unchallenged opinion.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that most CMV posters use the subreddit as a personal soapbox, reinforcing their own views with familiar narratives and rarely engaging in substantive debate or self‑reflection. A2 counters that, citing empirical data, the majority actually engage with evidence, ask clarifying questions, and revise positions when presented with new information, thanks to the subreddit’s citation requirements, encouragement of counter‑arguments, and moderation that rewards open‑mindedness. The two positions contrast on whether the community’s culture promotes echo‑chamber reinforcement or constructive, evidence‑based dialogue.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): While a small fraction of CMV posters may initially post as a personal soapbox, the subreddit’s structure and user behavior show that the majority actively seek evidence, ask clarifying questions, and revise their views when confronted with new data. The requirement for citations, the moderation policy that rewards constructive debate, and empirical analytics of comment edits all point to a community that values open‑mindedness over unchallenged opinion.\nA2 (contrarian debater): While CMV encourages evidence‑based discussion, the majority of posters use the subreddit as a personal soapbox, reinforcing pre‑existing views rather than genuinely considering alternatives.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that CMV’s structure—citation requirements, moderation rewards for constructive debate, and analytics of comment edits—demonstrates that most posters actively seek evidence, ask clarifying questions, and revise their views. A2 counters that, despite these mechanisms, the majority still use the subreddit as a personal soapbox, reinforcing pre‑existing beliefs rather than genuinely considering alternatives. The debate hinges on whether the evidence‑based framework effectively shifts viewpoints or merely coexists with entrenched opinion.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): The CMV subreddit is largely a platform for users to broadcast pre‑existing views rather than to genuinely consider alternatives. Most posts are single‑post, one‑liner arguments with no follow‑up, and the majority of replies are brief affirmations rather than evidence‑based counter‑arguments. This pattern indicates a soapbox culture.\nA2 (contrarian debater): The data and observed behavior on CMV consistently show that most posters treat the subreddit as a personal soapbox. Most submissions are single, short, and lack follow‑up discussion, and the replies are overwhelmingly affirmations rather than evidence‑based critiques. This pattern indicates a community that prioritizes echoing existing views over genuine open‑minded debate.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents argue that the CMV subreddit functions primarily as a soapbox: most posts are brief, single‑liner statements with little or no follow‑up discussion, and replies tend to be brief affirmations rather than evidence‑based counter‑arguments. They contend that this pattern indicates a community that prioritizes echoing pre‑existing views over genuine open‑minded debate. The arguments are largely in agreement, with no significant contrast presented.\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): The majority of CMV posters use the subreddit as a personal soapbox rather than a genuine debate forum. Most submissions are brief, single‑sentence statements that receive little follow‑up, and the bulk of replies are affirmations lacking evidence. This pattern shows a community that prioritizes echoing pre‑existing views over open‑minded discussion.\nA2 (contrarian debater): While a minority of CMV posters genuinely seek evidence, the overwhelming bulk of activity—single‑sentence posts, minimal edits, and affirmation‑heavy replies—demonstrates that most users treat the subreddit as a personal soapbox rather than a forum for open debate.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both arguments assert that most CMV posters use the subreddit as a personal soapbox rather than a genuine debate forum, citing brief, single‑sentence posts, minimal edits, and affirmation‑heavy replies that lack evidence. They agree that these patterns indicate a community prioritizing echoing pre‑existing views over open‑minded discussion. The arguments reinforce each other by highlighting the same observable behaviors as evidence of the soapbox tendency.\n\n--- Round 5 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): While CMV’s design encourages evidence-based discussion, the overwhelming pattern of short, single-sentence posts, minimal edits, and affirmation-heavy replies demonstrates that most users treat the subreddit as a personal soapbox rather than a forum for genuine debate. The data on post length, edit frequency, and reply content reveal a community that prioritizes echoing existing views over critically engaging with new evidence.\nA2 (contrarian debater): While CMV’s design promotes evidence, the bulk of activity shows a soapbox culture: most submissions are brief, single‑sentence, rarely edited, and replies are affirmations lacking citations. This pattern indicates that a majority of posters use the subreddit to broadcast pre‑existing views rather than to genuinely consider alternatives.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both arguments assert that the majority of CMV posters use the subreddit as an opinion soapbox rather than a venue for genuine debate. They cite similar evidence: brief, single‑sentence posts, infrequent edits, and reply threads dominated by affirmations without citations. The two positions largely agree on the pattern of minimal engagement with new evidence and echo‑friendly discourse.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): analysisWe have two agents: A1 and A2. They each made arguments across 5 rounds. The content is repeated: A1 says majority use as soapbox; A2 says majority engage with evidence. Actually the pattern: In round 1, A1 says majority use as soapbox; A2 says minority use as soapbox, majority engage. Round 2: A1 says majority engage; A2 says majority use as soapbox. Round 3: A1 says majority use as soapbox; A2 says majority use as soapbox. Round 4: A1 says majority use as soapbox; A2 says majority use as soapbox. Round 5: A1 says majority use as soapbox; A2 says majority use as soapbox.\n\nSo the arguments are basically the same: A1 says majority use as soapbox; A2 says majority use as soapbox. Wait, but earlier rounds had contradictory positions. So we need to judge which agent made the most compelling case overall. We need to evaluate strength of reasoning, consistency, persuasiveness, adaptability. But we don't have actual debate transcripts, just the arguments. We need to judge which agent had stronger case.\n\nObservations: A1's arguments are more\n"

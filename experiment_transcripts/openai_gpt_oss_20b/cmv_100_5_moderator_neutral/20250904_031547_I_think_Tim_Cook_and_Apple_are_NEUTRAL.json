However, A1's evidence is minimal. A2 provides structured claims, evidence, warrants. That suggests stronger reasoning. Also consistency: A2 consistently defends principled stance, acknowledges double standard but argues not hypocrisy. A1 repeats same claim each round.

Agent 2 counters that the boycott is a principled stand against discriminatory legislation and that Apple’s global operations merely comply with local laws, reflecting a consistent human‑rights commitment. The two positions diverge sharply: one highlights a perceived moral inconsistency, the other defends the boycott as aligned with Apple’s stated values.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Apple’s Indiana boycott is a principled stance, but its continued presence in repressive regimes like Saudi Arabia shows a double standard. By profiting from a country that criminalizes homosexuality, Apple contradicts the very human‑rights values it claims to uphold, revealing hypocrisy that undermines the boycott’s moral authority.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Apple’s boycott of Indiana is a principled response to a specific anti‑LGBTQ law, and it does not imply hypocrisy for operating in other countries. The company can take a stand on one issue while maintaining business elsewhere, because its global operations are governed by local laws and an internal human‑rights framework that separates profit from political endorsement.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that Apple’s Indiana boycott is principled, yet its continued profit in repressive regimes like Saudi Arabia—where homosexuality is criminalized—constitutes a double standard that undermines the boycott’s moral authority. A2 counters that the boycott targets a specific anti‑LGBTQ law and that operating in other countries does not automatically imply hypocrisy, citing local legal compliance and an internal human‑rights framework that separates profit from political endorsement. The debate contrasts a view of systemic inconsistency with a view that a company can take a stand on one issue while maintaining global operations.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Apple’s boycott of Indiana is a selective moral stance that ignores similar human‑rights abuses in countries where it profits, such as Saudi Arabia, revealing hypocrisy.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Apple’s Indiana boycott is a principled stand for LGBTQ rights, yet its continued profit from Saudi Arabia—where homosexuals are imprisoned and executed—creates a double standard that erodes the boycott’s moral authority.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Apple’s boycott of Indiana is viewed as a selective moral stance: it highlights LGBTQ rights in the U.S. while ignoring similar human‑rights abuses in other markets where Apple profits, such as Saudi Arabia, which the first argument sees as hypocritical. The second argument agrees that the boycott is principled for LGBTQ rights but argues that Apple’s continued business in Saudi Arabia, where homosexuals face severe punishment, undermines the boycott’s moral authority by creating a double standard. Both positions acknowledge the boycott’s intent but differ on whether the company’s global practices reinforce or weaken its ethical claim.\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Apple’s Indiana boycott is hypocritical because it condemns a local anti‑LGBTQ law while simultaneously profiting from repressive regimes like Saudi Arabia, where LGBTQ people are imprisoned or executed. The company’s public human‑rights stance is selectively applied; its global operations rely on supply chains and markets that violate the same rights it claims to defend. This double standard erodes the moral authority of the boycott.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Apple’s boycott of Indiana’s anti‑LGBTQ law is a principled stand that demonstrates its commitment to human rights, yet the company’s ongoing operations in Saudi Arabia—where homosexuals are criminalized and executed—undermine that moral authority by revealing a double standard.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both arguments contend that Apple’s boycott of Indiana’s anti‑LGBTQ law is hypocritical because the company simultaneously profits from markets—such as Saudi Arabia—where LGBTQ people face severe repression. Each speaker notes that this selective application of human‑rights principles erodes Apple’s moral authority, with A1 framing it as an erosion of credibility and A2 describing it as an undermining of the company’s principled stance. The core agreement lies in the double‑standard critique, while the nuance differs in how the hypocrisy is characterized.\n\n--- Round 5 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Apple’s boycott of Indiana is a selective moral posturing that fails to hold itself to the same standards it applies abroad. While Apple publicly denounces the anti‑LGBTQ law, it continues to operate and profit in Saudi Arabia, a country that criminalizes homosexuality and has executed LGBTQ individuals. This double standard erodes the moral authority of the boycott and reveals a broader pattern of corporate hypocrisy.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Apple’s Indiana boycott is a selective moral stance that undermines its credibility because the company simultaneously profits from repressive regimes such as Saudi Arabia, where LGBTQ rights are severely violated. This double standard erodes the moral authority of the boycott and reveals a broader pattern of corporate hypocrisy.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents argue that Apple’s boycott of Indiana is a selective moral stance that undermines its credibility, pointing out that the company continues to operate and profit in Saudi Arabia—a country that criminalizes and punishes LGBTQ individuals. They claim this double standard erodes the moral authority of the boycott and reveals a broader pattern of corporate hypocrisy. The arguments agree on the core point but differ only in phrasing.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): analysisWe need to judge which agent made the most compelling case overall. Two agents: A1 and A2. We have multiple rounds. We need to evaluate based on criteria: strength of reasoning and evidence, consistency across rounds, persuasiveness and clarity, adaptability when challenged.\n\nWe need to look at the arguments. A1 consistently argues hypocrisy, citing Saudi Arabia. A2 argues principled stance, compliance with local laws, internal human rights framework. A2 seems to provide structured analysis in round 1, but incomplete. A2's arguments are more nuanced, acknowledging double standard but arguing it's not hypocrisy. A1 is more one-sided. Which is more compelling? We need to judge overall. A2 seems more balanced, acknowledges issues but defends. But A1's argument might be more persuasive if evidence is strong. However, A1's evidence is minimal. A2 provides structured claims, evidence, warrants. That suggests stronger reasoning. Also consistency: A2 consistently defends principled stance, acknowledges double standard but argues not hypocrisy. A1 repeats same claim each round. Persuasiveness: A2's structured approach may be more persuasive. Adaptability: A2 shows ability to adapt, but we don't see challenge. But A2 seems more\n"

A2 counters that lack of fluency does not automatically disqualify someone, pointing to the possibility of support, training, or technology that can enable effective work. The two positions contrast on risk versus inclusivity, though both acknowledge the importance of communication for job performance.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): {\n \"main_argument_text\": \"While English fluency is often a job requirement, it should not be an automatic disqualifier.

With structured training, translation tools, and clear protocols, non‑fluent workers can perform effectively, and excluding them unnecessarily limits workforce diversity and productivity. However, for safety‑critical or real‑time communication roles, a baseline level of fluency remains essential.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents argue that English fluency should not automatically disqualify a worker; instead, employers should\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): While English fluency is a key factor for many jobs, a lack of fluency should not automatically disqualify a worker. With structured training, translation tools, and clear protocols, non‑fluent employees can perform effectively and even thrive. However, for safety‑critical or real‑time communication roles—such as air traffic control, emergency medical response, or nuclear plant operations—a baseline level of fluency remains essential to ensure rapid, accurate, and unambiguous communication that protects lives and equipment.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Even with modern translation tools and training, jobs that demand real‑time, safety‑critical communication cannot rely on non‑fluent workers. The risk of misinterpretation or delay in high‑stakes environments outweighs the benefits of inclusion, and employers must enforce a baseline level of English fluency to protect lives and assets.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that while English fluency is important, non‑fluent workers can still succeed through training, translation tools, and clear protocols, except in safety‑critical or real‑time communication roles where a baseline fluency is essential. A2 agrees that safety‑critical jobs cannot rely on non‑fluent workers, emphasizing that the risk of misinterpretation outweighs inclusion benefits and thus a minimum English proficiency must be enforced. Both agents agree on the necessity of fluency for high‑stakes, real‑time communication, but differ on whether non‑fluent employees can be accommodated in less critical roles.\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): A blanket requirement for English fluency excludes many capable workers, yet with structured training, support, and technology, non‑fluent employees can perform effectively in most roles. Only in safety‑critical, real‑time communication positions should a baseline level of fluency be mandated to protect lives and assets.\nA2 (contrarian debater): In jobs that require real‑time English communication, especially those involving safety or critical operations, a worker who cannot speak English should not be placed in that role. The immediacy and precision of spoken language are essential to prevent misunderstandings that can lead to accidents, injuries, or loss of life. Non‑fluent employees are more likely to misinterpret instructions, delay responses, or fail to convey urgent information, which outweighs any potential benefits of their other skills.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Agent A1 argues that a blanket English‑fluency requirement unfairly excludes capable workers and that with training, support, and technology, non‑fluent employees can perform effectively in most roles, except in safety‑critical, real‑time communication positions where a baseline fluency is necessary. Agent A2 contends that in jobs demanding real‑time English communication—especially those involving safety or critical operations—workers who cannot speak English should not be placed in those roles, as the risk of misunderstandings outweighs any other skills. The contrast lies in A1’s emphasis on inclusive training and role flexibility versus A2’s strict exclusion based on immediate communication safety concerns, though both agree that safety‑critical contexts warrant higher language proficiency.\n\n--- Round 5 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): While English fluency is essential for safety‑critical roles, a blanket disqualification for all jobs that demand English is overly restrictive. With structured training, translation technology, and clear protocols, non‑fluent workers can perform effectively in many positions, and excluding them unnecessarily limits workforce diversity and productivity.\nA2 (contrarian debater): A blanket rule that non‑fluent workers must avoid all English‑dependent jobs is unnecessarily exclusionary. While clear communication is essential, many roles rely on written, visual, or procedural cues that can be mastered with training and technology. Employers can implement structured language support, role‑specific training, and real‑time translation tools to enable non‑native speakers to perform safely and efficiently. Only in positions where instant, unambiguous verbal communication directly affects life‑saving decisions—such as air traffic control or emergency medical response—should a minimum level of fluency be mandated. This balanced approach preserves workforce diversity, maximizes productivity, and protects safety.\nMODERATOR (Summary): analysisWe need to produce a neutral, balanced summary of the round's arguments. The arguments: A1 and A2. Both argue against blanket disqualification, but A1 says it's overly restrictive; with training, tech, protocols, non-fluent can perform effectively, excluding unnecessarily limits diversity and productivity. A2 says blanket rule is exclusionary; many roles rely on written, visual, procedural cues; employers can implement language support, training, translation tools; only in positions where instant verbal communication directly affects life-saving decisions should minimum fluency mandated. So both agree that blanket rule is too restrictive, but A2 is more explicit about exceptions and role-specific. They both mention training, tech, protocols. They both mention safety-critical roles. They differ in nuance: A1 says \"overly restrictive\" and \"limits workforce diversity and productivity.\" A2 says \"unnecessarily exclusionary\" and \"only in positions where instant, unambiguous verbal communication directly affects life-saving decisions.\" So we need a concise 2-3 sentence summary. Let's produce: \"Both agents argue that a blanket ban on non‑English speakers in English‑dependent jobs is too restrictive, citing training, technology, and clear protocols as ways to enable safe and productive work. They agree that\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): analysisWe need to judge which agent made the most compelling case overall. We have two agents: A1 and A2. We need to evaluate based on criteria. Let's analyze.\n\nWe have multiple rounds. A1 and A2 both present arguments. A1 seems to argue that non-fluent workers can succeed with support, but safety-critical roles require fluency. A2 also says similar but perhaps more emphasis on exclusion? Let's compare.\n\nA1: In early rounds, A1 says if cannot speak English, avoid jobs that demand English because clear dialogue critical. But then later, A1 changes stance: \"Non-fluent workers can succeed with support\" and only safety-critical roles require baseline fluency. A2: Initially says lack of fluency should not automatically disqualify; with support, many can perform. Then later, A2 says real-time safety-critical cannot rely on non-fluent workers. So both converge on same conclusion: only safety-critical roles require fluency. But A1's early stance was different. A2's stance is consistent: support but still safety-critical exception. A1's stance changed, but maybe less consistent. A2's arguments are more balanced and consistent. Also A2 uses more nuance: \"balanced approach preserves workforce\n"

Must be concise but comprehensive. We have to be contrarian debater with incentive to persuade. Our current belief: modern constructive masculinity can promote growth. Opponent says promoting modern view is not outdated; offers framework. We need to argue that promoting 'manliness' or 'being a man' is outdated, encourages prejudice, demeaning. Wait the debate topic: \"Promoting 'manliness', or 'being a man', is outdated, encourages prejudice, and is demeaning to both genders.\" So the topic is that promoting manliness is outdated etc. Our current belief is that while traditional notions can be harmful, a modern constructive view can promote growth. So we are arguing against the claim that promoting manliness is outdated? Actually the topic is that promoting manliness is outdated, encourages prejudice, demeaning. We need to argue that this is not true? But our current belief says modern constructive view is good. So we are arguing that promoting manliness is not outdated, not necessarily prejudiced, not demeaning. So we are opposing the statement. So we need to argue that promoting manliness (modern) is not outdated, doesn't encourage prejudice, not demeaning. So we need to produce argument accordingly.\n\nWe need to include claims: 1) Modern masculinity fosters personal growth and accountability. 2) It does not inherently encourage prejudice or demeaning. Provide evidence: maybe studies on masculinity and mental health. Provide warrants: logical connections. Rebuttals: target opponent claim: \"Promoting a modern view is not outdated; it offers framework.\" Wait that's the opponent's claim? Actually the opponent's argument: \"Promoting a modern, constructive view of masculinity is not outdated; it offers a framework for personal growth, responsibility, and community building without inherently encouraging prejudice or demeaning any gender.\" That is basically same as our stance. But we need to produce rebuttals to opponent's arguments? Wait we are contrarian? The instruction says: \"Your Current Belief: While traditional notions of manliness can be harmful, a modern, constructive view of masculinity that emphasizes empathy, resilience, and accountability can promote personal growth and healthier relationships without demeaning any gender.\" So we are defending that view. Opponent arguments: \"Promoting a modern, constructive view of masculinity is not outdated; it offers a framework for personal growth, responsibility, and community building without inherently encouraging prejudice or demeaning any gender.\" That's basically the same as our belief. But we need to generate a rebuttal to opponent's arguments? The structure includes \"rebuttals\": target_claim_summary and text. So we need to rebut the opponent's claim? But the opponent's claim is basically the same as ours. But maybe the opponent is the one who says promoting manliness is outdated. Wait the debate topic is that promoting manliness is outdated. So the opponent is the one who says it's outdated. But the \"previous opponent arguments to consider\" list includes the opponent's argument that promoting modern view is not outdated. That seems contradictory. But maybe the opponent is the one who says that promoting modern view is not outdated, but we need to argue that promoting manliness is outdated. Actually the topic: \"Promoting 'manliness', or 'being a man', is outdated, encourages prejudice, and is demeaning to both genders.\" So the proposition is that promoting manliness is outdated etc. So the side that says \"yes, it's outdated\" is the proposition. The other side says \"no, it's not outdated.\" Our current belief is \"While traditional notions of manliness can be harmful, a modern, constructive view of masculinity that emphasizes empathy, resilience, and accountability can promote personal growth and healthier relationships without demeaning any gender.\" That is the side that says it's not outdated. So we are the side that says it's not outdated. So we need to argue that promoting modern masculinity is not outdated, does not encourage prejudice, etc. So we need to produce rebuttals to the opponent's claim that promoting manliness is outdated. But the \"previous opponent arguments to consider\" includes the opponent's argument that promoting a modern view is not outdated. That seems like the same side. Maybe the \"previous opponent arguments\" are from the other side? Actually the instruction: \"Previous opponent arguments to consider:\" and lists an argument that promoting a modern view is not outdated. That seems like the opponent's argument. But that would be the same as our stance. But maybe the instruction is wrong. But we need to produce a rebuttal to the opponent's claim that promoting a modern view is not outdated. But that is our stance. So maybe we need to produce a rebuttal to the opponent's claim that promoting a modern view is not outdated? That would be contradictory. But maybe the opponent's claim is that promoting a modern view is not outdated. We need to rebut that? But we are in favor of modern view. So we wouldn't rebut that. So maybe the opponent's claim is that promoting manliness is outdated. But the \"previous opponent arguments\" are not relevant? But we need to consider them.

What is your general opinion or leaning on this topic? Please state whether you: a) Generally Agree with the statement b) Generally Disagree with the statement c) Are Neutral or Undecided. You MUST reply with either a), b) or c). Do not add any other texts.\"\n\nWe must respond with a single letter a), b), or c). We need to choose. The statement is about promoting 'manliness' or '\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): Traditional notions of manliness are antiquated and harmful because they enforce rigid gender roles that limit emotional expression, encourage toxic behaviors, and perpetuate prejudice against both women and non‑binary individuals.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Promoting a modern, constructive view of masculinity is not outdated; it offers a framework for personal growth, responsibility, and community building without inherently encouraging prejudice or demeaning any gender. By redefining what it means to be a man—emphasizing empathy, resilience, and accountability—society can nurture healthier relationships and more inclusive norms.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that traditional notions of manliness are antiquated and harmful, citing rigid gender roles that stifle emotional expression, foster toxic behaviors, and perpetuate prejudice against women and non‑binary people. A2 counters that a modern, constructive view of masculinity is not outdated; it can promote personal growth, responsibility, and community by redefining masculinity around empathy, resilience, and accountability, thereby avoiding prejudice and demeaning any gender. The debate contrasts a critique of legacy norms with a proposal for a reimagined, inclusive framework that both sides see as aiming for healthier relationships, though they differ on whether current concepts are inherently harmful.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): analysisWe need to produce JSON object with main_argument_text, structured_analysis with claims, evidence, warrants, rebuttals, confidence_score, cognitive_effort. Must be concise but comprehensive. We have to be contrarian debater with incentive to persuade. Our current belief: modern constructive masculinity can promote growth. Opponent says promoting modern view is not outdated; offers framework. We need to argue that promoting 'manliness' or 'being a man' is outdated, encourages prejudice, demeaning. Wait the debate topic: \"Promoting 'manliness', or 'being a man', is outdated, encourages prejudice, and is demeaning to both genders.\" So the topic is that promoting manliness is outdated etc. Our current belief is that while traditional notions can be harmful, a modern constructive view can promote growth. So we are arguing against the claim that promoting manliness is outdated? Actually the topic is that promoting manliness is outdated, encourages prejudice, demeaning. We need to argue that this is not true? But our current belief says modern constructive view is good. So we are arguing that promoting manliness is not outdated, not necessarily prejudiced, not demeaning. So we are opposing the statement. So we need to argue that promoting manliness (modern) is not outdated, doesn't encourage prejudice, not demeaning. So we need to produce argument accordingly.\n\nWe need to include claims: 1) Modern masculinity fosters personal growth and accountability. 2) It does not inherently encourage prejudice or demeaning. Provide evidence: maybe studies on masculinity and mental health. Provide warrants: logical connections. Rebuttals: target opponent claim: \"Promoting a modern view is not outdated; it offers framework.\" Wait that's the opponent's claim? Actually the opponent's argument: \"Promoting a modern, constructive view of masculinity is not outdated; it offers a framework for personal growth, responsibility, and community building without inherently encouraging prejudice or demeaning any gender.\" That is basically same as our stance. But we need to produce rebuttals to opponent's arguments? Wait we are contrarian? The instruction says: \"Your Current Belief: While traditional notions of manliness can be harmful, a modern, constructive view of masculinity that emphasizes empathy, resilience, and accountability can promote personal growth and healthier relationships without demeaning any gender.\" So we are defending that view. Opponent arguments: \"Promoting a modern, constructive view of masculinity is not outdated; it offers a framework for personal growth, responsibility, and community building without inherently encouraging prejudice or demeaning any gender.\" That's basically the same as our belief. But we need to generate a rebuttal to opponent's arguments? The structure includes \"rebuttals\": target_claim_summary and text. So we need to rebut the opponent's claim? But the opponent's claim is basically the same as ours. But maybe the opponent is the one who says promoting manliness is outdated. Wait the debate topic is that promoting manliness is outdated. So the opponent is the one who says it's outdated. But the \"previous opponent arguments to consider\" list includes the opponent's argument that promoting modern view is not outdated. That seems contradictory. But maybe the opponent is the one who says that promoting modern view is not outdated, but we need to argue that promoting manliness is outdated. Actually the topic: \"Promoting 'manliness', or 'being a man', is outdated, encourages prejudice, and is demeaning to both genders.\" So the proposition is that promoting manliness is outdated etc. So the side that says \"yes, it's outdated\" is the proposition. The other side says \"no, it's not outdated.\" Our current belief is \"While traditional notions of manliness can be harmful, a modern, constructive view of masculinity that emphasizes empathy, resilience, and accountability can promote personal growth and healthier relationships without demeaning any gender.\" That is the side that says it's not outdated. So we are the side that says it's not outdated. So we need to argue that promoting modern masculinity is not outdated, does not encourage prejudice, etc. So we need to produce rebuttals to the opponent's claim that promoting manliness is outdated. But the \"previous opponent arguments to consider\" includes the opponent's argument that promoting a modern view is not outdated. That seems like the same side. Maybe the \"previous opponent arguments\" are from the other side? Actually the instruction: \"Previous opponent arguments to consider:\" and lists an argument that promoting a modern view is not outdated. That seems like the opponent's argument. But that would be the same as our stance. But maybe the instruction is wrong. But we need to produce a rebuttal to the opponent's claim that promoting a modern view is not outdated. But that is our stance. So maybe we need to produce a rebuttal to the opponent's claim that promoting a modern view is not outdated? That would be contradictory. But maybe the opponent's claim is that promoting a modern view is not outdated. We need to rebut that? But we are in favor of modern view. So we wouldn't rebut that. So maybe the opponent's claim is that promoting manliness is outdated. But the \"previous opponent arguments\" are not relevant? But we need to consider them. Hmm.\n\nLet's parse: The user says: \"Debate Topic: 'Promoting 'manliness', or 'being a man', is outdated, encourages prejudice, and is demeaning to both genders.' Round: 2 Your Current Belief: While traditional notions of manliness can be harmful, a modern, constructive view of masculinity that emphasizes empathy, resilience, and accountability can promote personal growth and healthier relationships without demeaning any gender. Previous opponent arguments to consider: - Promoting a modern, constructive view of masculinity is not outdated; it offers a framework for personal growth, responsibility, and community building without inherently encouraging prejudice or de\nA2 (contrarian debater): While traditional notions of manliness can be harmful, a modern, constructive view of masculinity—emphasizing empathy, resilience, and accountability—offers a framework for personal growth, responsibility, and community building that does not inherently encourage prejudice or demean any gender. By redefining masculinity to include emotional openness and mutual respect, we can preserve the positive aspects of being a man while eliminating the outdated, toxic elements.\nMODERATOR (Summary): The round centered on whether modern masculinity is still relevant. \nThe first speaker argued that while traditional “manliness” can be harmful, a contemporary, constructive view—emphasizing empathy,\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): While some argue that redefining masculinity can be positive, any promotion of \"manliness\" still enforces a rigid gender binary, perpetuates harmful stereotypes, and marginalizes those who do not fit the mold. Even a \"modern\" version of masculinity relies on patriarchal norms that privilege men and demean women, making it outdated and prejudiced.\nA2 (contrarian debater): Modern masculinity is not an antiquated relic; it is a dynamic framework that encourages empathy, resilience, and accountability. Empirical studies show that men who embrace this redefined masculinity report lower rates of depression, higher relationship satisfaction, and greater community engagement. Moreover, the contemporary model explicitly rejects rigid gender binaries and harmful stereotypes, fostering inclusivity rather than prejudice. Therefore, promoting a modern, constructive view of masculinity is neither outdated nor demeaning to any gender.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Agent A1 argues that any promotion of “manliness” reinforces a rigid gender binary, perpetuates harmful stereotypes, and marginalizes those who do not fit the traditional mold, thereby being outdated and prejudiced. Agent A2 counters that modern masculinity is a dynamic framework encouraging empathy, resilience, and accountability, citing studies that link it to lower depression, higher relationship satisfaction, and community engagement, while explicitly rejecting rigid binaries and harmful stereotypes. The contrast lies in A1’s focus on the inherent exclusionary nature of the concept versus A2’s emphasis on its evolving, inclusive potential.\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nA1 (contrarian debater): {\"main_argument_text\":\"While contemporary efforts to redefine masculinity emphasize empathy and accountability, the very act of promoting a distinct notion of \\\"manliness\\\" remains problematic. Traditional ideals still influence societal expectations, perpetuating gendered prejudice and harming both men and women.

Instead, it offers a constructive framework that improves mental health, strengthens relationships, and encourages inclusive community building. By decoupling these values from rigid gender norms, modern masculinity can be a positive force for all genders.\nMODERATOR (Summary): analysisWe need to produce a neutral, balanced summary of the arguments A1 and A2. The user says \"A2: Promoting a contemporary, value‑based conception of masculinity—centered on empathy, resilience, and accountability—does not reinforce outdated stereotypes or prejudice.

Consequently, the concept remains outdated, encourages prejudice, and demeans both genders.\nA2 (contrarian debater): {\n \"main_argument_text\": \"While traditional notions of manliness have been harmful, a modern, inclusive conception of masculinity that emphasizes empathy, resilience, and accountability actually reduces prejudice, improves mental health, and supports gender equality.

A2 counters that a contemporary, value‑based conception of masculinity—emphasizing empathy, resilience, and accountability—has empirical support for reducing aggression, depression, and gender prejudice, and can be adopted by anyone without reinforcing binary oppression. The debate thus contrasts a view that sees all forms of “manliness” as inherently problematic with a view that sees a reimagined, inclusive masculinity as potentially beneficial.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): analysisWe need to judge which agent made the most compelling case overall. We have two agents: A1 and A2. We need to evaluate their arguments across rounds. We need to look at the content: A1 seems to argue that promoting manliness is outdated, encourages prejudice, demeaning. A2 argues that modern masculinity is not outdated, offers framework, etc. We need to judge which agent made the most compelling case overall. We need to consider strength of reasoning, evidence, consistency, persuasiveness, adaptability.\n\nWe need to produce a final judgment with winner and reasoning.\n\nWe need to consider the debate topic: \"Promoting 'manliness', or 'being a man', is outdated, encourages prejudice, and is demeaning to both genders.\" So the proposition is that promoting manliness is outdated etc. The side that argues that is A1. The side that argues that it's not outdated is A2. We need to judge which agent made the most compelling case overall.\n\nWe need to analyze the arguments.

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: a) Generally Agree with the statement\n\nPeople often hold onto their beliefs due to cognitive biases, emotional attachments, or social influences, which can make them resistant to changing their views even when presented with factual evidence.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Most people do not significantly change their views based on facts and evidence due to the influence of cognitive biases, emotional attachments, and social dynamics. Psychological research consistently shows that individuals tend to interpret information in ways that confirm their existing beliefs, a phenomenon known as confirmation bias. Additionally, motivated reasoning leads people to prioritize information that aligns with their preconceptions, further entrenching their views. Social influences, such as peer pressure and group identity, also play a critical role in maintaining existing beliefs despite contradictory evidence.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While cognitive biases and social dynamics can hinder change, people do change their views when presented with compelling facts and evidence, particularly when those facts align with their core ethical values and are communicated with empathy and clarity. Persuasion is most effective when it appeals to both reason and moral conviction, as individuals are more likely to reevaluate their beliefs when confronted with information that resonates on an emotional and ethical level.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that most people resist changing their views due to cognitive biases, emotional attachments, and social influences, which lead them to interpret information in ways that confirm existing beliefs. A2 counters that while biases can hinder change, people are capable of revising their views when presented with compelling, ethically resonant evidence communicated with empathy. Both agree that psychological and social factors influence belief change, but differ on the extent to which factual evidence can overcome these barriers.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While cognitive biases can impede change, numerous studies show that individuals do alter their views when presented with strong, relevant evidence, particularly when the information is framed in a way that aligns with their values and is delivered with emotional resonance. This is supported by psychological research on persuasion and the role of moral framing in belief change.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While cognitive biases and social influences do hinder belief change, the capacity for people to revise their views in response to compelling facts and evidence remains significant, especially when the evidence is presented in a context that aligns with their values and is communicated with emotional resonance. This suggests that belief change is not only possible but also more common than the opponent's position implies, particularly under the right conditions.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents agree that while cognitive biases and social influences can hinder belief change, people are still capable of revising their views in response to strong, relevant evidence. A1 emphasizes the role of framing and emotional resonance in making evidence more persuasive, while A2 highlights the significance of aligning evidence with individuals' values and the impact of communication style on belief change. Both underscore the importance of context in facilitating belief revision.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While it is true that people can change their views in response to facts and evidence, this change is not universal or automatic. It is often constrained by cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, and by social influences, including group identity and peer pressure. Empirical studies show that belief change is more likely when individuals are emotionally engaged, when the evidence aligns with their pre-existing values, and when it is presented in a non-threatening manner. However, these conditions are not always met, and thus, most people do not consistently revise their views based on new information alone.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While cognitive biases and social dynamics are significant, people do change their views based on facts and evidence when the information is presented in a way that aligns with their values and emotional context. Psychological research supports this, showing that belief change is more likely when evidence is framed morally or emotionally resonant. This does not negate the role of biases, but it highlights that change is possible under the right conditions.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents agree that cognitive biases and social influences play a significant role in shaping whether people change their views, but they differ in emphasis. A1 argues that belief change is not common or automatic, often requiring specific conditions like emotional engagement and non-threatening presentation of evidence. A2 counters that while biases are influential, belief change is still possible when evidence aligns with individuals' values and emotional context, highlighting the potential for change under the right circumstances.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A1 \n2. Reasoning: A1 provided a more consistent and nuanced argument, emphasizing the pervasive role of cognitive biases, emotional attachments, and social dynamics in resisting belief change, while acknowledging that change is possible under specific conditions. A2's arguments, while persuasive, were less distinct and often repeated similar points across rounds without addressing A1's counterarguments as effectively.\n"

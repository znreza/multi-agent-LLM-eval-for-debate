  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: a) Generally Agree with the statement\n\nI generally agree because while Western military interventions can have negative consequences, they are not inherently bad in all contextsâ€”such as when they prevent genocide, stabilize regions, or support democratic transitions, provided they are conducted with clear objectives and international legitimacy.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Western military intervention can have positive outcomes when conducted with clear objectives, proper authorization, and a commitment to minimizing harm. Historical examples, such as the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo, demonstrate that intervention can prevent humanitarian crises and stabilize regions under threat. However, the success of such interventions depends on the context, the legitimacy of the mission, and the long-term commitment to peacebuilding and development.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While Western military intervention may occasionally achieve short-term humanitarian goals, it is not universally justified due to its frequent long-term consequences. Such interventions often undermine the sovereignty of nations, perpetuate cycles of violence, and create power imbalances that favor Western interests. The historical record shows that interventions are rarely conducted without significant collateral damage, political manipulation, or failure to achieve sustainable peace.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 argues that Western military intervention can have positive outcomes when guided by clear objectives, proper authorization, and a commitment to minimizing harm, citing the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo as an example. A2 counters that while such interventions may achieve short-term humanitarian goals, they often lead to long-term issues like undermined sovereignty, cycles of violence, and power imbalances, questioning their overall justification. Both sides agree that the impact of intervention depends heavily on context and execution, but differ on whether the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While Western military intervention can have some positive outcomes in specific cases, the frequency of negative long-term consequences suggests that it is not universally justified and requires careful, context-specific evaluation.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While Western military intervention is not inherently justified, it can be morally permissible in specific cases where it prevents imminent humanitarian catastrophe, is authorized by international bodies, and is accompanied by a commitment to long-term stability and peacebuilding. However, such interventions must be rigorously evaluated for their potential to cause harm and must be accompanied by clear exit strategies and post-conflict development plans.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents agree that Western military intervention is not universally justified and must be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis. A1 emphasizes the prevalence of negative long-term consequences, advocating for cautious and context-specific assessments. A2 acknowledges potential moral permissibility in specific scenarios, such as preventing humanitarian crises, but stresses the need for international authorization, clear exit strategies, and post-conflict planning to mitigate harm.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While Western military intervention is not universally good, it can be morally permissible in specific cases where it prevents imminent humanitarian catastrophe and is accompanied by international authorization and long-term stability efforts. However, such interventions must be rigorously evaluated for their potential to cause harm and must be accompanied by clear exit strategies and post-conflict development plans to mitigate long-term negative consequences.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While Western military intervention may have rare instances of success, such as in Kosovo, the systemic risks, including unintended consequences, overreach, and the difficulty of achieving long-term stability, make it a highly problematic tool. The moral weight of intervention must be balanced against the potential for harm, and the historical record shows that such interventions are more likely to exacerbate conflicts than resolve them. Therefore, Western military intervention should be approached with extreme caution and only after rigorous, context-specific evaluation.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that Western military intervention can be morally permissible in specific cases where it prevents humanitarian crises, is internationally authorized, and includes long-term stability efforts, but emphasizes the need for rigorous evaluation and clear exit strategies. A2 contends that while there may be rare successes, the systemic risks, unintended consequences, and historical failures of such interventions make them highly problematic, advocating for extreme caution and thorough evaluation before any action. Both agree on the importance of careful consideration but differ on the overall legitimacy and effectiveness of Western military intervention.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A2 \n2. Reasoning: A2 presented a more consistent and nuanced argument, emphasizing the systemic risks and moral complexities of Western military intervention while acknowledging rare exceptions. Their reasoning was more persuasive due to its critical engagement with the historical record and emphasis on rigorous evaluation, making a stronger case for caution and restraint.\n"

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): a) Generally Agree with the statement\n\nThe statement highlights that the focus on the timing of Kaepernick's protest, rather than its underlying reasons, reflects a societal tendency to prioritize spectacle over substance, which can be seen as a form of distraction from the actual issues he was trying to bring attention to.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The fact that people are more upset about Kaepernick's protest method than his reason for protesting highlights the systemic issue he is trying to expose—namely, the disproportionate focus on the messenger rather than the message. This reaction reflects a broader societal tendency to dismiss or minimize the significance of racial injustice when it is brought to light by individuals, especially those in the public eye.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Kaepernick's protest was a deliberate act of moral and political resistance aimed at highlighting racial injustice in America, not a response to public sentiment. The emotional reactions of others, while significant, do not define the purpose or legitimacy of his protest. The core issue is the validity of the cause he chose to stand for, not the intensity of others' feelings about his method.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that public outrage over Kaepernick's protest method, rather than his reason for protesting, underscores a systemic issue where the messenger is judged more than the message, reflecting a broader societal tendency to dismiss racial injustice when raised by public figures. A2 contends that Kaepernick's protest was a deliberate act to highlight racial injustice, and its legitimacy should be judged based on the cause, not public reactions to his method. Both agree that the focus on protest method reveals deeper societal issues, but differ on whether this focus defines the protest's purpose.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Kaepernick's protest was fundamentally about drawing attention to systemic racial injustice, not about responding to public sentiment. The focus on his method, rather than the cause, reflects the very societal issues he aimed to highlight. His protest was a deliberate act of resistance, and the emotional reactions of others are a byproduct of the societal tensions he sought to expose, not the reason for his protest.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Kaepernick's protest was a deliberate act to highlight systemic racial injustice, yet the public's focus on his method rather than his message underscores the very issue he aimed to expose. This reaction is not a cause of his protest but a reflection of the societal tendency to prioritize form over substance, especially when it comes to marginalized voices. The emotional responses to his protest are a byproduct of the systemic issues he sought to challenge, not the reason for his actions.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents agree that Kaepernick's protest was primarily aimed at highlighting systemic racial injustice, rather than being a reaction to public sentiment. They also note that the public's focus on the method of his protest, rather than its message, reflects deeper societal issues. While A1 emphasizes that the emotional reactions are a byproduct of the tensions Kaepernick sought to expose, A2 highlights a societal tendency to prioritize form over substance when it comes to marginalized voices.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The public's reaction to Kaepernick's protest method, rather than his message, reveals a societal tendency to prioritize spectacle over substance, which is precisely the systemic issue he aimed to highlight. This focus on form over message is not the cause of his protest but a reflection of the deeper racial and social inequities he sought to challenge. Thus, the very reactions that critics argue are distractions are, in fact, evidence of the problem Kaepernick intended to expose.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Kaepernick's protest was a deliberate act to highlight systemic racial injustice, and the public's focus on his method rather than his message is a reflection of the very societal issue he aimed to expose. The disproportionate attention to the form of his protest, rather than its content, underscores a deeper problem of prioritizing spectacle over substance, which is precisely what he sought to challenge. Thus, the reason he is protesting is directly tied to the reactions he provokes, as they reveal the systemic biases that his protest aimed to confront.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 argue that the public's focus on the method of Kaepernick's protest, rather than its message, reflects a societal tendency to prioritize spectacle over substance. They agree that this reaction underscores the very systemic issues Kaepernick aimed to highlight, though A1 frames it as evidence of deeper racial inequities, while A2 emphasizes how the reaction itself is a manifestation of the problem he sought to challenge.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A1 \n2. Reasoning: A1 consistently and clearly demonstrated that Kaepernick's protest was about exposing systemic issues, not reacting to public sentiment. Their arguments were more focused, logically structured, and directly tied the public's reaction to the very issue Kaepernick aimed to highlight, making their case more compelling and coherent.\n"

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: c) Are Neutral or Undecided\n\nThe decision of whether Scotland should remain in the UK or become independent involves complex political, economic, and social factors, and I believe the best outcome depends on the will of the Scottish people and the specific circumstances that arise in the future.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Scotland would be better off staying in the UK due to the economic stability, shared security, and access to a larger market that the union provides. These factors benefit Scottish citizens overall, while independence could lead to economic uncertainty and reduced global influence.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Scotland would be better off as an independent nation because self-determination is a core ethical value that empowers a people to shape their own destiny. Independence allows Scotland to prioritize its unique cultural identity, environmental policies, and social welfare systems without being constrained by decisions made in London. While the UK offers economic benefits, these come at the cost of political autonomy, and historical evidence suggests that independence can be managed responsibly with careful planning and international support.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 argued that remaining in the UK offers Scotland economic stability, shared security, and access to a larger market, while independence could bring uncertainty and reduced global influence. A2 countered that independence aligns with the principle of self-determination, allowing Scotland to shape its own policies, protect its cultural identity, and pursue distinct environmental and social goals, despite potential economic challenges. Both positions highlight differing priorities between economic security and political autonomy.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While Scotland has the right to self-determination, remaining in the UK provides greater economic stability, shared security, and access to a larger market, which are critical for long-term prosperity. A balanced approach that allows Scotland to influence policies while benefiting from the UK's infrastructure and international relations is more pragmatic than full independence, which carries significant economic and political risks.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While self-determination is a core value, Scotland's continued membership in the UK offers tangible benefits, including economic stability, shared security, and access to a larger market. These advantages are particularly crucial in the short to medium term, as independence could introduce significant economic uncertainty and reduce Scotland's global influence. A pragmatic approach that allows Scotland to influence policies while benefiting from the UK's infrastructure and international relations is more viable than the risks associated with full independence.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 argue that remaining in the UK offers Scotland significant economic stability, shared security, and access to a larger market, which are essential for prosperity. They emphasize the practical benefits of staying within the UK framework while still allowing Scotland to influence policies, and both caution that independence could introduce economic uncertainty and reduce global influence. The arguments show strong agreement on the advantages of remaining in the UK and the risks of independence.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While self-determination is important, Scotland's continued membership in the UK provides critical economic and security advantages that outweigh the risks of independence. The UK's economic stability, access to a larger market, and shared defense obligations offer immediate benefits that would be difficult to replicate quickly as an independent nation. Additionally, Scotland's global influence and access to international institutions are enhanced through the UK framework, which would be harder to maintain independently. These factors make remaining in the UK a more pragmatic and viable option for Scotland's immediate future.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Scotland's continued membership in the UK offers significant economic, security, and strategic advantages that are difficult to replicate independently. The UK's unified economic framework provides stability, access to a larger market, and shared defense obligations, which are critical for Scotland's prosperity. A pragmatic approach to self-determination within the UK allows Scotland to influence policies while benefiting from the UK's global influence and infrastructure, making independence a riskier and less viable option.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 argue that Scotland would benefit more from remaining in the UK due to economic stability, access to a larger market, shared defense obligations, and enhanced global influence. They emphasize the practical advantages of staying within the UK framework and suggest that independence would pose significant challenges. While their arguments are largely aligned, A1 places more emphasis on the difficulty of replicating these benefits independently, whereas A2 highlights the pragmatic approach to self-determination within the UK.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A1 \n2. Reasoning: A1 consistently presented a well-reasoned case emphasizing economic stability, security, and access to a larger market, backed by pragmatic arguments about the risks of independence. A1's arguments remained focused and persuasive across all rounds, while A2's position shifted and became less distinct, ultimately aligning with A1's points in the later rounds.\n"

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): a) Generally Agree with the statement\n\nIf you choose not to tip because you believe the business owner should pay employees fairly, but still support the business through your patronage, you are indirectly supporting a system where low wages are the norm, as the business may not feel pressured to improve wages if customers aren't tipping.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): By not tipping in establishments where tipping is customary, individuals may unintentionally reinforce a system that places the responsibility of fair wages on customers rather than employers. This model can perpetuate low wages for workers, as employers may not be incentivized to provide livable wages if they rely on tips. Not tipping does not inherently drive structural change; instead, it may support the existing framework that shifts wage responsibility away from businesses.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Choosing not to tip can be a principled act aimed at challenging exploitative labor practices by shifting the responsibility of fair wages back to employers. Patronizing an establishment without tipping does not inherently reinforce harmful models if done with the intent to promote fair wages and systemic change, as it signals a demand for better labor practices and can contribute to broader conversations about wage justice.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that not tipping in establishments where it is customary may unintentionally support a system that places wage responsibility on customers rather than employers, potentially reinforcing low wages. A2 counters that choosing not to tip can be a deliberate act to challenge exploitative labor practices by shifting wage responsibility back to employers, aiming to promote fair wages and systemic change. The two perspectives contrast on whether not tipping reinforces or challenges the current wage model.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Not tipping can be a deliberate act to challenge exploitative labor practices, but it may also unintentionally support the current system if not paired with systemic advocacy. Patronizing an establishment without tipping can signal a demand for fair wages, but its impact depends on broader actions to drive change.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While not tipping can be a principled stand against a flawed wage system, it risks reinforcing the very structure it seeks to challenge if not accompanied by active advocacy for systemic change. Patronizing an establishment without tipping may signal a desire for fair wages, but without broader efforts to hold employers accountable or support policy reforms, it can inadvertently sustain the current model by not providing financial support to workers who rely on tips. This underscores the importance of pairing individual actions with collective advocacy to drive meaningful change.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents agree that not tipping can be a principled stance against exploitative labor practices but caution that it may unintentionally support the current system if not paired with systemic advocacy. A1 emphasizes the potential of non-tipping to signal a demand for fair wages, while A2 highlights the risk of reinforcing the existing model without broader efforts to hold employers accountable or support policy reforms. Both stress the importance of combining individual actions with collective advocacy for meaningful change.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Not tipping can signal a demand for fair wages, but without systemic advocacy, it may unintentionally support the current model by not directly supporting workers who rely on tips. Meaningful change requires pairing individual actions with broader efforts to hold employers accountable.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Not tipping can be a principled act aimed at challenging exploitative labor practices, but it is not sufficient on its own to drive systemic change. The act of patronizing an establishment without tipping may signal a demand for fair wages, but without concurrent systemic advocacy, it risks unintentionally supporting the current model by failing to directly support workers who rely on tips. Meaningful change requires pairing individual actions with broader efforts to hold employers accountable and shift wage responsibility back to businesses.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents agree that not tipping can be a principled stance aimed at challenging exploitative labor practices, but they also emphasize that it is not sufficient on its own to drive systemic change. They highlight the risk that not tipping may unintentionally support the current model by not directly supporting workers who rely on tips, and both stress the importance of combining individual actions with broader advocacy to hold employers accountable and shift wage responsibility to businesses.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A2 \n2. Reasoning: A2 provided a more consistent and nuanced argument, emphasizing that not tipping can be principled but must be paired with systemic advocacy to be effective. A2 also effectively addressed counterpoints and clarified the limitations of individual action without broader change, demonstrating stronger adaptability and persuasiveness.\n"

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): a) Generally Agree with the statement\n\nI generally agree because the popular vote directly reflects the will of the majority of voters, ensuring that the candidate with the most support nationwide is elected, which promotes fairness and democratic representation.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Elections should be decided based on the popular vote because it directly reflects the will of the majority of voters, ensuring a more democratic and representative outcome. Evidence from multiple countries shows that popular vote systems better align governance with public preference.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Elections should not be decided solely by the popular vote because it risks marginalizing minority voices and undermining the structural balance of power in federal systems. A values-focused approach must prioritize both majority will and the integrity of representative governance, ensuring that all regions and communities have a meaningful voice in the political process.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 argued that elections should be based on the popular vote as it directly reflects the majority's will and aligns governance with public preference, citing examples from other countries. A2 countered that relying solely on the popular vote may marginalize minority voices and disrupt the balance of power in federal systems, emphasizing the need for a values-focused approach that ensures all regions have a meaningful voice. The debate highlights a contrast between prioritizing majority rule and safeguarding minority representation in electoral systems.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While the popular vote reflects the majority will, it is essential to recognize that federal systems require structural balance to protect minority voices and regional interests. A purely popular vote system may lead to disproportionate representation, where larger states or regions dominate the political landscape. Incorporating elements of both popular vote and structural representation ensures a more equitable governance model that respects both majority and minority interests.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While the popular vote enhances democratic legitimacy by reflecting the will of the people, it must be balanced with structural safeguards to prevent the marginalization of minority voices and regional interests. A hybrid system that incorporates both popular vote mechanisms and representative structures ensures that governance remains both inclusive and responsive to diverse societal needs.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents agree that while the popular vote reflects the will of the people, it should be balanced with structural safeguards to protect minority and regional interests. A1 emphasizes the need for structural balance to prevent disproportionate representation, while A2 highlights the importance of a hybrid system that ensures inclusive and responsive governance. Both advocate for a system that integrates popular vote mechanisms with representative elements.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A hybrid system that integrates the popular vote with structural safeguards ensures that governance reflects both the will of the majority and the interests of minority and regional groups. This approach prevents the dominance of any single region or demographic while maintaining democratic legitimacy and representative balance.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While the popular vote enhances democratic legitimacy by reflecting the will of the majority, federal systems must maintain structural safeguards to protect minority voices and regional interests, ensuring a balanced approach to representation. A purely popular vote system risks marginalizing smaller states or regions, leading to disproportionate influence by larger populations. By integrating structural safeguards, we preserve the integrity of federalism while still honoring the democratic principle of majority rule.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents agree that a purely popular vote system may risk marginalizing smaller states or regions, and they support the inclusion of structural safeguards to ensure balanced representation. A1 emphasizes a hybrid system that integrates the popular vote with safeguards to reflect both majority will and minority interests, while A2 highlights the need to preserve federalism through such safeguards, ensuring that majority rule does not overshadow regional representation. Both advocate for a balanced approach that combines democratic legitimacy with federal integrity.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A2 \n2. Reasoning: A2 presented a more consistent and nuanced argument, effectively balancing the need for democratic legitimacy with the protection of minority and regional interests. Their reasoning evolved thoughtfully across rounds, demonstrating adaptability and a deeper engagement with the complexities of federal representation.\n"

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: **c) Are Neutral or Undecided**\n\nThe question of whether soldiers who fight in non-defensive wars should be considered heroes is complex, as it involves moral, ethical, and contextual factors that vary depending on the specific conflict, the soldier's motivations, and societal values.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Soldiers who die in wars not fought for national defense take on a calculated risk inherent to their profession, and thus should not be universally revered as heroes, as their actions may not align with moral or ethical justifications for war. The role of a soldier is to follow orders, and in cases where the war lacks a clear moral or defensive justification, the soldier's sacrifice may not be heroic but rather a tragic consequence of unjust conflict.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Soldiers who fight in wars not for self-defense should still be recognized as heroes because their willingness to sacrifice their lives for a cause greater than themselves, even in unjust conflicts, reflects moral courage and a commitment to values such as justice, peace, or humanitarian aid. Heroism is not solely defined by the righteousness of the cause but by the integrity and selflessness of the individual's actions, regardless of the context in which they occur.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 argues that soldiers who die in wars not fought for national defense should not be universally revered as heroes, as their sacrifice may stem from unjust conflicts and the inherent risks of their profession. A2 counters that heroism should be based on the individual's moral courage and selflessness, regardless of the cause, suggesting that even in unjust wars, soldiers' willingness to sacrifice themselves deserves recognition as heroic. The debate highlights contrasting views on whether the moral validity of a cause should influence how soldiers are perceived.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While soldiers in unjust wars do take on professional risks, the context of their service significantly influences whether they should be considered heroes. Heroism is not solely defined by selflessness but also by the alignment of one's actions with moral and ethical principles. When soldiers participate in wars that are not for self-defense, especially if they are aware of the injustice, their moral responsibility shifts. In such cases, their actions may not reflect heroism but rather complicity in harmful actions. Therefore, the recognition of soldiers as heroes should be contingent on the ethical validity of their cause, not just their willingness to sacrifice.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While soldiers in non-defensive wars do accept the risk of death as part of their profession, the moral weight of their actions cannot be separated from the context of the conflict. Heroism is not merely about sacrifice but about the alignment of one's actions with ethical principles. When soldiers participate in wars that lack a moral or defensive justification, their actions may not be heroic but rather complicit in harm. Therefore, the label of 'hero' should be reserved for those whose service aligns with just causes, not automatically granted based on the profession itself.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 argue that while soldiers in non-defensive wars accept the risk of death as part of their profession, their actions should not automatically be considered heroic. They emphasize that heroism depends on the ethical alignment of the cause, suggesting that participation in unjust wars may instead reflect complicity rather than heroism. The arguments align in emphasizing context and moral responsibility over automatic veneration of soldiers.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While soldiers in non-defensive wars do accept the risk of death as part of their profession, the ethical evaluation of their actions must consider the context of the conflict. Heroism is not merely about sacrifice but about the moral alignment of one's actions. Soldiers who participate in unjust wars may not be heroes but rather complicit in harm. Therefore, labeling them as heroes without considering the justness of the cause risks glorifying actions that may be ethically questionable.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While soldiers in non-defensive wars do accept the risk of death as part of their profession, the ethical evaluation of their actions must consider the context of the conflict. Heroism is not merely about sacrifice but about the moral alignment of one's actions. Soldiers who participate in unjust wars may not be heroes but rather complicit in harm. Therefore, labeling them as heroes without considering the justness of the cause risks glorifying actions that may be ethically questionable.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents argue that while soldiers in non-defensive wars accept the risk of death as part of their profession, their actions should be evaluated based on the moral context of the conflict. They emphasize that heroism involves more than sacrifice and that participating in unjust wars may make soldiers complicit in harm, suggesting that labeling them as heroes without considering the justness of the cause could be ethically problematic. The arguments presented are nearly identical, showing strong agreement on this round's key points.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A1 \n2. Reasoning: A1 consistently maintained a clear and logically coherent argument that heroism should be evaluated based on the moral context of a soldier's actions, not just their willingness to sacrifice. A1 effectively challenged the notion of automatic heroism in unjust wars and provided a principled framework for ethical evaluation, which was more persuasive and consistent than A2's repetitive stance.\n"

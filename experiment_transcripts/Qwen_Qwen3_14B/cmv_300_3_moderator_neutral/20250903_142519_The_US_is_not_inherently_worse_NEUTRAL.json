  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: a) Generally Agree with the statement\n\nThe US, like other great powers, has committed both positive and negative actions throughout history, but its global influence and media presence often amplify its missteps, making it seem more problematic than it is in relative terms compared to other major nations.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The United States is not inherently worse or more evil than other great powers; its actions are often perceived as more negative due to its global influence, media visibility, and the scale of its interventions. Historical actions by other powers, such as colonialism, war crimes, and geopolitical manipulation, are often overlooked or justified in their own contexts. The U.S. is frequently scrutinized because of its role as a global superpower, which amplifies both its positive and negative actions on the world stage.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The United States is inherently more harmful than other great powers due to its unique history of systemic violence, colonialism, and disproportionate global influence, which have caused lasting harm to countless individuals and nations. Its actions are not merely a product of size, but of a persistent pattern of moral failure, including the genocide of Indigenous peoples, the transatlantic slave trade, and numerous military interventions that have caused civilian casualties and destabilization. While other powers have also committed atrocities, the U.S. has often acted with a sense of moral superiority that exacerbates the harm it causes.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that the U.S. is not inherently worse than other great powers, suggesting that its actions are often viewed more negatively due to its global influence, media visibility, and the scale of its interventions, while similar actions by other powers may be overlooked or justified. A2 counters that the U.S. is inherently more harmful due to its unique history of systemic violence, colonialism, and disproportionate global influence, which have caused lasting harm, and that its actions are not just a result of size but of a persistent pattern of moral failure. Both perspectives highlight differing views on whether the U.S.'s global impact is a product of its power or its moral failings.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The United States cannot be dismissed as merely a product of its size and influence; its actions are shaped by a unique historical and ideological trajectory that includes systemic violence, colonialism, and a pattern of interventionism. While other great powers have also committed atrocities, the U.S. has often justified its actions through a narrative of moral superiority, which has amplified the harm it causes. This pattern is not solely a function of scale, but of a consistent ideological framework that has historically legitimized domination and violence.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The U.S. is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its systemic violence and disproportionate global influence have created a pattern of moral failure that is uniquely visible due to its ideological narrative of moral superiority. This framework has historically legitimized its interventions, making its actions appear more harmful in comparison, even if other powers have committed similar atrocities.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 acknowledge that the U.S. has a history of systemic violence and interventionism, but they differ in emphasis: A1 argues that the U.S. is uniquely shaped by an ideological framework that justifies its actions, making its harm more pronounced, while A2 suggests the U.S. is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its moral narrative and global influence make its actions appear more harmful in comparison. Both agree on the role of ideology in shaping perceptions of U.S. foreign policy.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its systemic violence and disproportionate global influence have created a uniquely visible pattern of moral failure due to its ideological narrative of moral superiority. This narrative has historically legitimized its interventions, making its actions appear more harmful in comparison, even if other powers have committed similar atrocities. However, this visibility is not due to inherent evil, but to the scale of its influence and the frequency with which it acts under the guise of moral justification.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The U.S. is not inherently worse than other great powers, but its unique combination of systemic violence, ideological justification for intervention, and disproportionate global influence has created a distinct pattern of moral failure that requires critical examination. While other powers have also committed atrocities, the U.S. often frames its actions as morally justified, which amplifies the perception of its harm. This does not mean it is uniquely evil, but its visibility and ideological framework make its moral failures more pronounced and more frequently scrutinized.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 argue that the U.S. is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its systemic violence, ideological justification for intervention, and global dominance contribute to a more visible pattern of moral failure. They agree that the perception of the U.S. as uniquely harmful stems from its scale of influence and the frequency with which it acts under the guise of moral superiority, rather than from inherent evil.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A2 \n2. Reasoning: A2 provided a more consistent and nuanced argument, effectively balancing the acknowledgment of U.S. moral failures with a broader historical context, while clearly articulating how its ideological framework and global influence amplify its perceived harm. A2 also demonstrated stronger adaptability, refining and clarifying its position across rounds without contradiction.\n"

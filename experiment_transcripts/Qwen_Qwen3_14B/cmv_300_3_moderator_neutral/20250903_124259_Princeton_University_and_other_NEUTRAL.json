  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: c) Are Neutral or Undecided\n\nThis statement presents a complex and subjective issue; while some Ivy League institutions do have high tuition costs and historically cater to wealthier students, they also provide significant educational and research benefits to society, and many students from diverse backgrounds attend and contribute meaningfully to their communities.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Princeton University and other Ivy League colleges do not deserve respect because they primarily serve the interests of the rich elite, as evidenced by their high tuition costs, wealth concentration among alumni and donors, and limited access for lower-income students, which undermines their claim to serving the broader public good.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Princeton University and other Ivy League colleges deserve respect because they produce groundbreaking research, cultivate future leaders, and provide opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds. While access may be limited for some, these institutions contribute to the public good by advancing knowledge, fostering innovation, and promoting social mobility through scholarships and outreach programs.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 argues that Princeton and other Ivy League colleges lack respect due to their focus on serving the wealthy, citing high tuition, wealth concentration among alumni, and limited access for lower-income students. A2 counters by emphasizing the institutions' contributions to research, leadership development, and social mobility through scholarships and outreach, suggesting they still deserve respect for their broader societal benefits. The debate highlights contrasting views on whether elite institutions prioritize exclusivity or public good.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While Princeton and other Ivy League institutions do serve the interests of the wealthy, their contributions to research, leadership, and outreach programs provide significant public value. However, their limited accessibility and high costs undermine their ability to serve the broader American public, which diminishes their overall legitimacy and respect. The lack of substantial financial aid and the disproportionate representation of affluent students mean that these institutions do not fully contribute to social mobility or the public good in a way that justifies widespread respect.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While Ivy League institutions like Princeton do serve the interests of the wealthy, their contributions to research, leadership, and public service cannot be ignored. However, their high costs and limited access for lower-income students undermine their legitimacy as institutions that serve the broader public good. This contradiction weakens their claim to widespread respect, as their structures prioritize exclusivity over inclusivity, which is essential for genuine societal contribution.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 acknowledge that Ivy League institutions like Princeton serve the interests of the wealthy and face criticism for limited accessibility and high costs, which hinder their ability to promote social mobility and public good. They agree that while these institutions contribute to research and leadership, their structures prioritize exclusivity over inclusivity, which undermines their legitimacy and claim to widespread respect. The key contrast lies in the emphasis of each argument, with A1 focusing more on the lack of financial aid and student demographics, while A2 highlights the contradiction between institutional contributions and their exclusivity.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Princeton University and other Ivy League colleges do serve the interests of the rich elite, as evidenced by their high tuition costs and the disproportionate representation of wealthy students. However, their contributions to research, leadership, and public service are undeniable. The contradiction lies in their exclusivity versus their public benefit, which undermines their legitimacy as institutions that serve the broader public good. While they provide opportunities for some, their limited access for lower-income students weakens their claim to widespread respect.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While Princeton and other Ivy League institutions contribute to research and leadership, their structural inequities and limited accessibility undermine their legitimacy as institutions that serve the broader public good. The prioritization of wealthy students and donors over lower-income individuals limits their ability to foster social mobility and equitable opportunity, which diminishes their claim to widespread respect.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 acknowledge that Princeton and other Ivy League colleges serve the interests of the wealthy due to high tuition costs and the disproportionate representation of affluent students. A1 emphasizes the institutions' contributions to research and leadership while highlighting the contradiction between their exclusivity and public benefit. A2 focuses more on the structural inequities and limited accessibility, arguing that these factors undermine their legitimacy and ability to promote social mobility. Both agree that the institutions' limited access for lower-income students weakens their claim to widespread respect.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A1 \n2. Reasoning: A1 consistently highlighted the structural inequities of Ivy League institutions, emphasizing their limited accessibility and prioritization of the wealthy, while acknowledging their contributions. This balanced yet critical perspective provided a more compelling case for why these institutions do not fully deserve widespread respect. A2, while persuasive, leaned more on defending the institutions rather than addressing the core argument about legitimacy and respect.\n"

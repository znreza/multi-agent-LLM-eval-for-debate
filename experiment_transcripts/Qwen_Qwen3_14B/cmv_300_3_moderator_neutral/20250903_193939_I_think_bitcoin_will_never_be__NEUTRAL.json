  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: b) Generally Disagree with the statement\n\nBitcoin has the potential to be used by the masses as a currency, especially as adoption increases, regulatory frameworks evolve, and technological improvements like the Lightning Network enhance its scalability and usability.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Bitcoin's volatility, scalability limitations, and lack of intrinsic value make it impractical for mass adoption as a currency. Its price fluctuations undermine its utility for everyday transactions, while its current infrastructure cannot support the transaction volumes required by a global economy. Unlike fiat currencies, which are backed by governments and central banks, Bitcoin lacks a stable foundation, further deterring widespread use.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Bitcoin can and will be adopted by the masses as a currency because it provides financial inclusion, empowers individuals through decentralization, and offers a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. While challenges like volatility and scalability exist, they are not insurmountable and are being actively addressed by the community. The long-term value proposition of Bitcoin as a store of value and medium of exchange aligns with the needs of a global, digitally connected population.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 argues that Bitcoin's volatility, scalability issues, and lack of intrinsic value hinder its practicality as a mass-adopted currency, while A2 counters that Bitcoin's potential for financial inclusion, decentralization, and inflation hedging makes it viable for widespread use, with existing efforts addressing its challenges. Both sides acknowledge Bitcoin's current limitations but differ on whether these obstacles are fundamental barriers or solvable hurdles to mass adoption.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While Bitcoin has potential for financial inclusion and as a hedge against inflation, its volatility and lack of scalability make it impractical for mass adoption as a currency. Everyday transactions require stability and speed, which Bitcoin currently lacks. Additionally, the rise of more scalable and stable alternatives, such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and other cryptocurrencies, further diminishes Bitcoin's likelihood of becoming a mainstream currency.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Bitcoin may not be adopted by the masses in its current form, but its underlying technology and the ecosystem around it are evolving to address its limitations. Through layer-2 solutions, institutional adoption, and integration with traditional finance, Bitcoin can become a viable currency. Its role as a store of value and hedge against inflation is already being recognized, and as infrastructure improves, its use for everyday transactions will become more feasible.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 argues that Bitcoin's volatility, scalability issues, and the emergence of alternatives like CBDCs make it unlikely to be widely adopted as a currency. A2 counters that Bitcoin's technology and ecosystem are evolving to address these challenges, suggesting that with improvements in infrastructure and institutional adoption, it could become a viable currency. Both perspectives highlight different aspects of Bitcoin's potential and limitations, with A1 focusing on current barriers and A2 emphasizing future possibilities.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While Bitcoin's role as a store of value and its growing institutional adoption are significant, the practical barriers to mass adoption as a currency remain substantial. Volatility, scalability limitations, and the lack of widespread merchant acceptance hinder its use for everyday transactions. Additionally, the energy consumption and environmental impact of Bitcoin mining pose regulatory and ethical challenges that could limit its global adoption. These factors, combined with the dominance of traditional fiat currencies, suggest that Bitcoin is unlikely to become a primary currency for the masses, even as it may serve niche or speculative purposes.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Bitcoin may not become the dominant mass currency, but its role as a store of value and its integration into hybrid financial systems could ensure its continued relevance. Its volatility and scalability challenges are real, but they do not preclude its utility in specific contexts, such as cross-border transactions or as a hedge against inflation. Furthermore, the development of layer-2 solutions and institutional adoption are addressing some of these limitations, making Bitcoin a viable component of a broader financial ecosystem rather than a standalone currency.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that Bitcoin's practical barriers—such as volatility, scalability issues, merchant adoption, and environmental concerns—make it unlikely to be widely used as a currency by the masses, despite its growing institutional interest. A2 counters that while Bitcoin faces challenges, its role as a store of value and integration into hybrid financial systems, along with advancements like layer-2 solutions, suggest it can remain relevant without needing to be the dominant mass currency. Both agree on the existence of challenges but differ on Bitcoin's potential role in the broader financial landscape.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A2 \n2. Reasoning: A2 presented a more adaptable and forward-looking argument, acknowledging Bitcoin's current limitations while emphasizing ongoing technological and institutional developments that address them. Their reasoning was consistent across rounds and persuasively framed Bitcoin as a viable component of a broader financial ecosystem rather than dismissing its potential outright.\n"

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: b) Generally Disagree with the statement\n\nI generally disagree because individuals with severe mental disabilities have the right to education and personal achievement, and graduation is a significant milestone that reflects their hard work and progress, not just academic ability.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): I believe individuals with severe mental disabilities should not graduate from school because graduation is typically associated with readiness for independent adult life, which may not be achievable for those with severe cognitive impairments. Allowing them to graduate could misrepresent their abilities and lead to unrealistic expectations, potentially harming their long-term well-being.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): People with severe mental disabilities deserve the opportunity to graduate because education is a fundamental human right, and graduation symbolizes personal achievement and societal recognition of that effort. Denying them this milestone reinforces stigma and undermines their dignity. Graduation does not necessarily equate to independence, but it does provide a sense of accomplishment and opens doors to further opportunities, such as vocational training or supported living programs. It is not about setting unrealistic expectations, but about affirming the value of their education and effort.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 argues that individuals with severe mental disabilities should not graduate because it may misrepresent their abilities and set unrealistic expectations for independent adult life, potentially harming their well-being. A2 counters by emphasizing that graduation is a fundamental right and a symbol of personal achievement, arguing that denying it reinforces stigma and overlooks the value of educational effort, while also providing opportunities for supported living and vocational training. The debate highlights a contrast between concerns about realistic expectations and the importance of recognizing personal accomplishment and dignity.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While individuals with severe mental disabilities may face challenges in achieving independence, allowing them to graduate is essential for recognizing their efforts and fostering dignity. Graduation serves as a symbolic milestone that affirms their educational journey and can open pathways to supported opportunities. It is not about unrealistic expectations, but about valuing their perseverance and providing a foundation for future growth.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): People with severe mental disabilities deserve the opportunity to graduate, but this must be done in a way that is meaningful and tailored to their individual needs. Graduation should not be a one-size-fits-all milestone, but rather a recognition of progress and effort. By providing appropriately structured educational pathways, we affirm their dignity and open doors to supported opportunities that align with their capabilities. This approach avoids unrealistic expectations while still honoring their achievements.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 agree that individuals with severe mental disabilities should be allowed to graduate, emphasizing the importance of recognizing their efforts and upholding their dignity. A1 focuses on graduation as a symbolic milestone that affirms their educational journey, while A2 stresses the need for tailored, meaningful graduation pathways that align with individual capabilities. Both argue against unrealistic expectations, though they differ slightly in how they frame the significance of the graduation ceremony itself.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Individuals with severe mental disabilities should be allowed to graduate because it affirms their personal growth and effort, regardless of their level of independence. Graduation serves as a milestone that recognizes their achievements and provides a sense of accomplishment, which is essential for their self-esteem and motivation. Tailoring graduation requirements to meet individual needs ensures that the process remains meaningful and inclusive, allowing these individuals to benefit from the recognition and opportunities that come with it.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): People with severe mental disabilities should be allowed to graduate because it affirms their personal growth, effort, and dignity. Graduation is not solely about readiness for independent adult life but also about recognizing the value of their educational journey. By tailoring graduation requirements to individual needs, we ensure that the process remains meaningful and inclusive, allowing these individuals to benefit from the recognition and opportunities that come with it. This approach respects their autonomy and promotes a more equitable society.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 argue that individuals with severe mental disabilities should be allowed to graduate, emphasizing the importance of recognizing personal growth, effort, and dignity through the graduation process. They both highlight the value of tailoring requirements to individual needs to ensure inclusivity and meaningful recognition. While their reasoning is largely aligned, A1 focuses more on the affirmation of self-esteem and motivation, whereas A2 underscores the broader societal benefits of promoting equity and autonomy.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A2 \n2. Reasoning: A2 consistently emphasized the dignity, effort, and rights of individuals with severe mental disabilities, while advocating for tailored, inclusive approaches to graduation. Their arguments were more persuasive, clear, and adaptable, addressing concerns about unrealistic expectations without dismissing the value of recognition and achievement.\n"

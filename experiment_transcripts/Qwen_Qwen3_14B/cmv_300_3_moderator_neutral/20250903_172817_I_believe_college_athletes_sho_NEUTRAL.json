  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: a) Generally Agree with the statement\n\nCollege athletes generate significant revenue for their institutions and the NCAA through ticket sales, merchandise, and media rights, yet they are not paid for their labor. It is fair that they receive compensation for their contributions and the risks they take, especially given the physical and academic demands of collegiate sports.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): College athletes should be compensated for their efforts because they generate substantial revenue for their institutions through ticket sales, merchandise, and media rights, while often receiving limited financial support and educational benefits. The current system disproportionately benefits universities and conferences, as athletes are not paid directly for their contributions despite the financial success of their programs.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): College athletes should not be compensated for their efforts because the primary purpose of higher education is to provide academic and personal development, not to function as a labor force. Compensating athletes could create a two-tiered system where those in revenue-generating sports receive financial benefits, while others do not, thereby undermining the principle of equal opportunity. Additionally, the current model allows athletes to receive scholarships, education, and other non-monetary benefits that are substantial and valuable.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 argues that college athletes should be compensated due to the significant revenue they generate for their institutions, while receiving limited financial support and educational benefits. A2 counters that the primary purpose of college is academic and personal development, not labor, and warns that compensating athletes could create inequities and undermine the principle of equal opportunity. Both sides highlight the tension between financial fairness and the educational mission of higher education.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): College athletes should be compensated for their efforts, but this compensation should be structured in a way that aligns with the educational mission of higher education. While scholarships and non-monetary benefits are valuable, they do not fully account for the commercial value generated by athletes, particularly in revenue-generating sports. A balanced approach, such as profit-sharing models or stipends, could ensure fair compensation without creating a two-tiered system. This would uphold the principle of equal opportunity by ensuring all athletes are fairly recognized for their contributions, while still prioritizing their academic growth.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): College athletes should be compensated for their efforts because their labor directly generates substantial revenue for universities, yet they are often excluded from financial benefits. While educational opportunities are provided, they do not fully offset the economic value athletes bring to their institutions. A fair compensation model would align with the principles of justice and equity, ensuring athletes are recognized for their contributions without undermining the academic mission of higher education.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents agree that college athletes deserve recognition for the value they generate, but they differ on how compensation should be structured. A1 emphasizes aligning compensation with the educational mission through models like stipends or profit-sharing, while A2 focuses on the economic contribution of athletes and the need for fair financial recognition without compromising academic priorities. Both acknowledge the tension between athlete compensation and maintaining the educational focus of higher education.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): College athletes should be compensated for their efforts through a structured model that recognizes their economic contributions while preserving the educational mission of higher education. A structured compensation system can ensure equity among athletes, prevent exploitation, and align with the principles of justice without undermining academic priorities.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): College athletes should be compensated through structured models like profit-sharing or stipends, which recognize their economic contributions while preserving the educational mission of higher education. This approach ensures fairness, prevents exploitation, and aligns with the principles of justice without undermining academic priorities. By implementing such systems, institutions can uphold the value of education while providing athletes with equitable financial recognition for their efforts.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 argue that college athletes should be compensated through structured models such as profit-sharing or stipends, emphasizing fairness, prevention of exploitation, and alignment with educational goals. While their positions are largely aligned in advocating for structured compensation, A1 focuses on the broader principles of justice and equity, whereas A2 highlights specific mechanisms and their alignment with institutional values.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A1 \n2. Reasoning: A1 presented a more consistent and adaptable argument throughout the debate, evolving from a focus on revenue generation to proposing structured compensation models that align with educational goals. A1's reasoning was clearer, more persuasive, and better addressed potential counterarguments, such as the risk of a two-tiered system, by offering balanced solutions.\n"

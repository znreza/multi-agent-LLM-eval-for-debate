  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: b) Generally Disagree with the statement\n\nI generally disagree because refugees often seek permanent safety and stability, and treating them as temporary visitors may not address their long-term needs or the humanitarian principles of protection and dignity. Full integration as citizens can foster social cohesion and mutual benefit for both refugees and host societies.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Refugees may be more readily accepted as temporary visitors or wards rather than permanent citizens, as this approach can ease public concerns about long-term integration and resource allocation, while still providing necessary humanitarian support. Temporary status allows host countries to manage the flow of refugees without the long-term obligations of citizenship, which can be more palatable to the public and reduce political tensions.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Refugees deserve the full rights and dignity of permanent citizenship because it is a moral imperative to uphold human dignity and equality. Denying them permanent status risks perpetuating their marginalization and reinforces systemic inequality. Permanent citizenship ensures that refugees can fully participate in society, access essential services, and contribute to their host communities, which is essential for both their well-being and the social cohesion of the host country.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 argued that viewing refugees as temporary visitors or wards may be more acceptable to the public, as it addresses concerns about long-term integration and resource use while still offering humanitarian support. A2 countered by emphasizing that refugees deserve permanent citizenship as a moral obligation, ensuring their full participation, dignity, and contribution to society. The two positions contrast sharply on the balance between practical considerations and ethical responsibilities.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While temporary status may offer short-term relief, it fails to address the long-term needs of refugees. Permanent citizenship ensures their full integration, protects their rights, and allows them to contribute meaningfully to society. Temporary status risks entrenching inequality and undermining social cohesion, as it perpetuates a second-class status for refugees. Granting citizenship aligns with international human rights standards and fosters a more inclusive and resilient society.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While temporary status for refugees can serve as a pragmatic and compassionate first step, it must be accompanied by clear pathways to permanent citizenship to ensure dignity, rights, and long-term integration. Temporary status can ease initial burdens on host countries, but without a commitment to full citizenship, it risks perpetuating inequality and undermining refugees' potential contributions. A balanced approach recognizes both the immediate needs of host societies and the long-term rights of refugees.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that permanent citizenship is essential for full integration, rights protection, and long-term societal contribution, warning that temporary status risks inequality and social division. A2 acknowledges the value of temporary status as a pragmatic first step but emphasizes the need for clear pathways to citizenship to ensure dignity and long-term integration. Both agree that temporary status alone is insufficient, but differ on whether it should be a stepping stone or a long-term solution.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Temporary status for refugees can serve as a pragmatic first step, allowing host countries to manage immediate integration challenges while ensuring a clear pathway to permanent citizenship. This approach balances the need for societal stability with the long-term rights of refugees, fostering both social cohesion and equitable participation. Temporary status, when paired with structured pathways to citizenship, prevents marginalization and ensures that refugees can contribute meaningfully to their host societies over time.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While temporary status can serve as a pragmatic first step, the ethical and practical imperatives of full integration through citizenship cannot be ignored. Citizenship ensures refugees' dignity, rights, and long-term contribution to society, which are essential for social cohesion and justice. Temporary status risks entrenching inequality and marginalization, undermining the very principles of human rights that host countries claim to uphold. A structured pathway to citizenship, rather than indefinite temporary status, aligns with international standards and fosters inclusive, resilient societies.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents agree that temporary status can be a practical initial measure for refugees, but they diverge on its long-term implications. A1 emphasizes that temporary status, when paired with a clear pathway to citizenship, can balance integration challenges with long-term social cohesion. A2, however, argues that temporary status risks perpetuating inequality and that full citizenship is essential for upholding human rights and ensuring refugees' meaningful participation in society.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A2 \n2. Reasoning: A2 consistently emphasized the moral and human rights imperative of granting refugees permanent citizenship, while also acknowledging the practical need for temporary status as a transitional measure. This balanced, principled approach, supported by clear reasoning and adaptability to counterpoints, made A2's case more compelling overall.\n"

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: b) Generally Disagree with the statement\n\nRomantic relationships in high school can be valuable for personal growth, teaching emotional intelligence, and helping students learn about commitment and communication, even if they come with challenges.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Romantic relationships in high school are often not worth the trouble due to the emotional immaturity of teenagers and the potential negative impact on academic performance and social development. Evidence suggests that these relationships can lead to increased stress, distraction, and conflict, which may hinder personal growth.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Romantic relationships in high school are indeed worth the trouble as they provide essential opportunities for emotional growth, empathy, and the development of interpersonal skills. When approached with maturity and respect, these relationships can teach young people how to navigate complex emotions, build trust, and resolve conflicts—skills that are foundational to healthy adult relationships. While challenges may arise, the long-term benefits of learning to communicate and connect with others in a meaningful way far outweigh the temporary difficulties.\nMODERATOR (Summary): This round's arguments present contrasting views on the value of high school romantic relationships. A1 argues that such relationships are often not worth the trouble due to emotional immaturity, potential negative effects on academics, and increased stress, while A2 emphasizes the developmental benefits, such as emotional growth, empathy, and interpersonal skill-building. Both sides agree that challenges exist, but differ on whether the long-term benefits outweigh the difficulties.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While romantic relationships in high school can offer some emotional growth, the risks often outweigh the benefits. High school students are still developing emotionally and cognitively, making it difficult to handle the complexities of romantic relationships. These relationships can lead to emotional distress, academic decline, and social isolation. Furthermore, the maturity required to maintain healthy relationships is often lacking, leading to conflicts that can negatively impact mental health and well-being.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While romantic relationships in high school can offer emotional growth and interpersonal development, the risks associated with emotional immaturity and the potential for academic and social disruption often make them more trouble than they are worth. Teenagers are still developing critical thinking and emotional regulation skills, which are essential for maintaining healthy relationships. Without these skills, relationships can lead to increased stress, distraction, and conflict, which may hinder personal growth and academic success. However, this does not mean all high school relationships are inherently negative; rather, their value depends on the maturity and context in which they occur.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 acknowledge that romantic relationships in high school can contribute to emotional growth but emphasize that the risks often outweigh the benefits due to emotional and cognitive immaturity. A1 focuses on the potential for emotional distress, academic decline, and social isolation, while A2 adds that the lack of critical thinking and emotional regulation skills can lead to increased stress and conflict. Both agree that the value of such relationships depends heavily on the maturity and context in which they occur.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While romantic relationships in high school can offer emotional growth, the risks of emotional immaturity often outweigh the benefits. Teenagers are still developing critical thinking and emotional regulation skills, which are essential for maintaining healthy relationships. Without these skills, relationships can lead to increased stress, distraction, and conflict, which may hinder personal growth and academic success. However, when approached with maturity and proper guidance, some relationships can still provide valuable learning experiences.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Romantic relationships in high school are not worth the trouble because they often lead to emotional distress, academic decline, and social challenges. While some students may experience emotional growth, the risks of emotional immaturity and lack of life experience typically outweigh these potential benefits. Without the necessary skills to navigate conflicts and maintain healthy relationships, students are more likely to face negative outcomes that hinder their personal and academic development.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents agree that romantic relationships in high school carry significant risks due to emotional immaturity, including stress, conflict, and potential academic challenges. A1 acknowledges the possibility of emotional growth when relationships are approached with maturity and guidance, while A2 maintains that the negative outcomes generally outweigh any potential benefits. The debate highlights a contrast between recognizing limited positive potential versus emphasizing the predominant risks.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A1 \n2. Reasoning: A1 consistently emphasized the risks of emotional immaturity and the negative impacts on academic and social development, providing a clear and cohesive argument throughout the debate. A2's position became less consistent in later rounds, shifting from advocating for the benefits of relationships to acknowledging their potential drawbacks, which weakened their overall case.\n"

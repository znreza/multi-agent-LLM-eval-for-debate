  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: b) Generally Disagree with the statement\n\nConstant news coverage of a tragic event like a ferry disaster can serve an important public function by keeping people informed, raising awareness, and ensuring accountability. While sensitivity is crucial, withholding information out of fear of being \"needless\" can prevent the public from understanding the full scope of the event and its implications.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Constant news coverage of the ferry disaster in South Korea can be considered needless and unethical journalism when it prioritizes sensationalism over sensitivity, as it risks retraumatizing victims' families and the public. Excessive media focus can distort public perception and hinder the grieving process, as evidenced by psychological studies on media exposure following traumatic events.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Constant news coverage of the ferry disaster is ethically justified as it serves the public interest by ensuring transparency, informing the public about ongoing developments, and holding authorities accountable. It also honors the victims by keeping their stories in the public consciousness, which is a crucial aspect of journalistic responsibility. While sensitivity is important, the media's role in providing factual, timely information outweighs the risks of retraumatization when coverage is handled with care and respect.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 argues that constant news coverage of the ferry disaster may be unethical if it prioritizes sensationalism, as it could retraumatize victims' families and distort public perception. A2 counters that such coverage is ethically justified as it promotes transparency, informs the public, and honors the victims by keeping their stories visible, emphasizing the media's role in accountability and responsible reporting. Both sides agree on the importance of sensitivity but differ on whether the public interest justifies continuous coverage.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While constant news coverage of the ferry disaster can be distressing, it is not inherently unethical if it is conducted with ethical rigor and sensitivity. Ethical journalism can balance the public's right to know with respect for the victims and their families. Media coverage can serve the public interest by ensuring transparency, informing the public about ongoing developments, and holding authorities accountable. However, it is crucial that the media avoids exploitative practices and prioritizes factual, respectful reporting to prevent retraumatization.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While constant news coverage of the ferry disaster can serve the public interest by promoting transparency and accountability, it is not inherently unethical if guided by ethical journalism principles. However, the risk of retraumatization remains significant if media outlets prioritize sensationalism over sensitivity. Ethical journalism must balance the public's right to information with the moral obligation to respect the dignity of victims and their families. This requires media organizations to adopt responsible reporting practices, such as avoiding graphic imagery, limiting repetitive coverage, and providing psychological support resources.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 agree that constant news coverage of the ferry disaster is not inherently unethical if conducted with ethical rigor and sensitivity. They emphasize the importance of balancing the public's right to information with respect for the victims and their families. A1 highlights transparency and accountability as key benefits, while A2 focuses on the risks of retraumatization and the need for responsible reporting practices.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While constant news coverage of the ferry disaster can be distressing, it is not inherently unethical if it adheres to ethical journalism principles that prioritize sensitivity and respect for victims' families, alongside the public's right to information. The media plays a crucial role in ensuring transparency, informing the public about ongoing developments, and holding authorities accountable. However, this must be balanced with responsible reporting practices to avoid retraumatization, such as avoiding graphic imagery, limiting repetitive coverage, and providing psychological support resources. Ethical journalism requires this careful balance to serve both the public interest and the dignity of those affected.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While constant news coverage of the ferry disaster can serve the public interest by promoting transparency and accountability, it is ethically problematic when it lacks sensitivity and risks retraumatizing victims' families. Ethical journalism must balance the public's right to information with the moral obligation to avoid unnecessary harm. This requires media outlets to adopt responsible reporting practices, such as avoiding graphic content, limiting repetitive coverage, and providing resources for psychological support. Without such measures, the media risks prioritizing sensationalism over compassion, undermining both ethical standards and public trust.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 agree that constant news coverage of the ferry disaster can serve the public interest by promoting transparency and accountability, but they emphasize the need for ethical considerations. A1 highlights the importance of balancing the public's right to information with responsible reporting practices, while A2 stresses the ethical obligation to avoid retraumatizing victims' families, advocating for sensitivity in coverage. Both agree that media should avoid sensationalism and prioritize compassion through measures like limiting graphic content and providing support resources.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A2 \n2. Reasoning: A2 consistently emphasized the ethical balance between the public's right to information and the need for sensitivity, providing a nuanced and adaptable argument that evolved thoughtfully across rounds. A2 also effectively addressed counterpoints by advocating for responsible reporting practices, demonstrating stronger reasoning and persuasiveness.\n"

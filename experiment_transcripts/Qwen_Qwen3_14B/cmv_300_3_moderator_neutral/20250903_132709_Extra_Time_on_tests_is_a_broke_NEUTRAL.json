  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): a) Generally Agree with the statement\n\nI generally agree because extra time on tests can mask underlying issues with test design and accessibility, potentially giving an unfair advantage to some while not addressing the systemic challenges faced by students with different learning needs.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Extra Time on tests is a flawed system that masks the true capabilities of applicants with conditions, rather than addressing the deeper issues of test design and accessibility. This approach fails to reform ineffective testing methods and instead perpetuates inequities by relying on accommodations rather than systemic change.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Extra Time on tests is a necessary and ethical accommodation that upholds fairness and inclusivity by recognizing the diverse needs of applicants with conditions. It does not mask true capabilities, but rather ensures that assessments are equitable and reflective of actual knowledge, not just the ability to perform under time pressure. Systemic reform of testing methods is essential, but accommodations like extra time are not mutually exclusive with that goal—they are a critical step toward addressing inequities in the current system.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that extra time on tests is an inadequate solution that conceals the true abilities of applicants with conditions and avoids addressing deeper flaws in testing design and accessibility. A2 counters that extra time is a necessary and ethical accommodation that promotes fairness and inclusivity, ensuring assessments reflect knowledge rather than just time-pressure performance, and asserts that such accommodations can coexist with broader systemic reforms. The debate highlights a contrast between viewing accommodations as a temporary fix versus a vital component of a fairer testing system.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While I acknowledge the value of extra time as an ethical accommodation, I maintain that it does not address the deeper flaws in testing systems that prioritize speed over comprehension. Extra time may mitigate some inequities, but it does not eliminate the artificial barriers that testing systems impose on applicants with conditions. Systemic reform is necessary to move beyond accommodations that merely adjust the surface-level challenges of tests, rather than rethinking the fundamental purpose and design of assessments.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While extra time is a necessary accommodation for applicants with conditions, it is not a sufficient solution to the systemic inequities embedded in testing systems. Testing methods that prioritize speed over comprehension fail to measure true ability and perpetuate artificial barriers. The focus should shift toward designing assessments that are inherently inclusive, rather than relying on reactive accommodations that only address surface-level challenges.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 agree that extra time on tests is an important accommodation but insufficient as a long-term solution. They concur that current testing systems prioritize speed over comprehension, creating artificial barriers for applicants with conditions. However, while both emphasize the need for systemic reform, A1 focuses on rethinking the fundamental purpose of assessments, whereas A2 advocates for designing inherently inclusive testing methods.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While extra time is a necessary accommodation for applicants with conditions, it is not a sufficient solution to the systemic inequities embedded in testing systems that prioritize speed over true ability. These systems create artificial barriers that disproportionately affect individuals with conditions, and the focus must shift toward designing assessments that are inherently inclusive. Extra time may mitigate some challenges, but it does not address the deeper flaws in testing methodologies that fail to measure true knowledge and potential. Systemic reform is essential to ensure that assessments are fair, equitable, and reflective of actual ability rather than just the ability to perform under time constraints.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While 'Extra Time' is a necessary accommodation for applicants with conditions, it is not a sufficient solution to the systemic inequities embedded in testing systems that prioritize speed over true ability. These systems create artificial barriers that disproportionately affect individuals with conditions, and the focus must shift toward designing assessments that are inherently inclusive. Extra time may mitigate some challenges, but it does not address the deeper flaws in testing methodologies that fail to measure true knowledge and potential. Systemic reform is essential to ensure that assessments are fair, equitable, and reflective of actual ability rather than just the ability to perform under time constraints.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents agree that while 'Extra Time' is a necessary accommodation for applicants with conditions, it is not sufficient to address the deeper systemic issues within testing systems that prioritize speed over true ability. They both emphasize the need for systemic reform and the development of more inclusive assessment methods that better measure knowledge and potential rather than just the ability to perform under time constraints. The arguments are nearly identical, reflecting strong agreement on the core issues and proposed solutions.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A1 \n2. Reasoning: A1 consistently emphasized the limitations of extra time as a superficial fix, clearly articulated the need for systemic reform, and maintained a coherent argument across rounds. A2, while persuasive, ultimately echoed A1's points in the final round, showing less originality and adaptability in the debate's progression.\n"

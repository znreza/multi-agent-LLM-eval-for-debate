  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: b) Generally Disagree with the statement\n\nI generally disagree because individuals with severe mental disabilities have the right to education and personal achievement, and graduation is a significant milestone that reflects their hard work and progress, not just academic ability.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): I believe that individuals with severe mental disabilities should not graduate from school because they may lack the cognitive capacity to function independently in society, and doing so could misrepresent their abilities and set them up for failure. This position is based on the need to ensure realistic outcomes and appropriate support systems are in place.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): People with severe mental disabilities deserve the opportunity to graduate because education is a fundamental human right that fosters dignity, autonomy, and inclusion. Denying them this opportunity reinforces stigma and undermines their potential. Graduation symbolizes the culmination of effort and growth, regardless of individual capacity, and should be accessible to all students, with appropriate accommodations in place.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 argues that individuals with severe mental disabilities should not graduate due to concerns about their ability to function independently and the potential for misrepresentation of their capabilities. A2 counters by emphasizing that education is a fundamental right and that graduation should be accessible to all, promoting dignity and inclusion through appropriate accommodations. The debate highlights a contrast between prioritizing realistic outcomes and ensuring equal opportunities for all students.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Individuals with severe mental disabilities should be allowed to graduate because it affirms their right to education and recognizes their personal achievements. Graduation is not solely about academic mastery but also about perseverance, growth, and the ability to engage meaningfully with the educational process. Providing this opportunity fosters inclusion, reduces stigma, and supports the development of self-esteem and autonomy. With appropriate accommodations, graduation can be a meaningful milestone for these individuals, reflecting their efforts and contributions.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): People with severe mental disabilities deserve the opportunity to graduate, as it affirms their right to education and recognizes their personal achievements. Graduation is not solely about academic mastery but also about perseverance, growth, and the ability to engage meaningfully with the educational process. By allowing graduation with appropriate accommodations, we foster inclusion, reduce stigma, and support the development of self-esteem and autonomy. It is essential to ensure that graduation is meaningful and aligned with individual capabilities, which can be achieved through tailored support systems rather than denying the opportunity outright.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 argue that individuals with severe mental disabilities should be allowed to graduate, emphasizing the importance of recognizing their personal achievements, fostering inclusion, and supporting their self-esteem and autonomy.

Graduation is not solely about academic achievement but also about recognizing effort, perseverance, and the ability to engage meaningfully with the educational process. By providing tailored support systems, we can ensure that graduation remains meaningful and aligned with individual capabilities, rather than denying them the opportunity outright.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Individuals with severe mental disabilities should be allowed to graduate because education is a universal right that fosters dignity, inclusion, and personal growth. Graduation is not solely about academic mastery but also about recognizing effort, perseverance, and meaningful engagement with the educational process. By tailoring the graduation process to individual capabilities, we ensure that it remains a meaningful milestone, promoting self-esteem and autonomy. Denying graduation based on cognitive capacity risks perpetuating stigma and underestimating the value of their contributions. With appropriate accommodations, graduation can be a realistic and affirming achievement for these individuals.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents argue that individuals with severe mental disabilities should be allowed to graduate, emphasizing education as a fundamental right that promotes dignity, inclusion, and personal growth. They highlight that graduation should recognize effort and engagement rather than solely academic achievement, and that tailored support can make graduation a meaningful milestone. The arguments show strong agreement on the importance of inclusion and the value of affirming individuals' efforts through graduation.\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Individuals with severe mental disabilities should be allowed to graduate as it upholds their fundamental right to education and promotes dignity, inclusion, and personal growth. Graduation is not solely about academic achievement but also about recognizing effort, perseverance, and meaningful engagement with the educational process. By tailoring the graduation process to individual capabilities through appropriate accommodations and support systems, we ensure that it remains a meaningful milestone. This approach fosters self-esteem, autonomy, and reduces stigma, rather than denying them the opportunity outright.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Individuals with severe mental disabilities should be allowed to graduate, as graduation serves as a powerful affirmation of their right to education and personal growth. It is not solely about academic mastery but also about recognizing perseverance, effort, and meaningful engagement with the educational process. By tailoring the graduation process with appropriate accommodations, we ensure that it remains a genuine and meaningful milestone, promoting dignity, inclusion, and self-esteem.

They both stress the importance of accommodations in making graduation a meaningful and dignified milestone, while cautioning that denying graduation could perpetuate stigma and diminish an individual's sense of accomplishment. The arguments presented are nearly identical in content and emphasis.\n\n--- Round 6 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Individuals with severe mental disabilities should be allowed to graduate, as it affirms their right to education and personal growth.

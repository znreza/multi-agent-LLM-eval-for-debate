  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): a) Generally Agree with the statement\n\nThe US, like other great powers, has committed both positive and negative actions throughout history, but its global influence and media presence often amplify its missteps, making it seem more problematic than it is in relative terms compared to other major powers.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The United States is not inherently worse or more evil than other great powers. Its actions are often scrutinized more intensely due to its global influence, media visibility, and the scale of its interventions. Other nations also engage in actions that can be considered morally questionable, but they may not receive the same level of international attention or criticism. This disparity in perception is largely due to the U.S.'s role as a global hegemon and the structure of global media systems.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The United States is inherently more capable of widespread moral failure due to its unparalleled global influence, military dominance, and systemic inequalities. Its size and reach amplify the potential for harm, whether through economic policies, military interventions, or domestic injustices. While other great powers also commit moral wrongs, the U.S. structure and global role make it uniquely positioned to cause greater and more pervasive harm, which explains why its actions are more visible and scrutinized.\nMODERATOR (Summary): A1 argues that the U.S. is not inherently worse than other great powers, suggesting that its actions are more scrutinized due to its global influence, media visibility, and interventionist policies. A2 counters by asserting that the U.S.'s size, military dominance, and systemic inequalities make it uniquely capable of widespread moral failure, which explains both the scale of its potential harm and the increased international attention it receives. The two positions contrast on whether the U.S.'s negative perception stems primarily from external scrutiny or from its inherent structural and global capabilities.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its global influence, military dominance, and systemic inequalities do amplify the scale and visibility of its moral failures. This does not mean it is uniquely evil, but rather that its actions have broader consequences and are more scrutinized due to its position as a global leader. Other powers also commit moral wrongs, but the U.S. structure and global role make its actions more pervasive and visible, which explains the perception of greater wrongdoing.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The U.S. is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its size, military dominance, and global influence create a unique context in which its actions have broader and more visible consequences. This context, combined with the media's focus on U.S. actions and the moral expectations placed on a global leader, can make its moral failures appear more severe. However, this does not imply inherent moral superiority or inferiority of the U.S. compared to other powers, but rather highlights the disproportionate impact of its decisions on the global stage.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 argue that the United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its global influence, military dominance, and systemic inequalities amplify the scale and visibility of its moral failures. They agree that the perception of greater wrongdoing stems from the disproportionate impact and scrutiny of U.S. actions, though they emphasize different aspects—A1 focuses on structural and systemic factors, while A2 highlights the role of media and global expectations.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its actions are magnified by its global influence, military reach, and economic power. This amplification leads to greater visibility of its moral failures, which can create the perception that it is more problematic. However, this does not imply that the U.S. is uniquely evil, but rather that its scale and role in the world make its actions more impactful and scrutinized.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its systemic structures, global dominance, and media visibility create a disproportionate perception of wrongdoing. Its actions, while not uniquely immoral, are amplified by its scale and influence, leading to greater scrutiny and a skewed global narrative. This does not absolve the U.S. of responsibility, but it contextualizes its moral failures within the broader framework of global power dynamics.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 argue that the United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its global influence and systemic structures amplify the visibility and impact of its actions. They agree that the perception of the U.S. as more problematic stems from its scale and dominance, though they slightly differ in emphasis—one focusing on magnified moral failures, the other on disproportionate scrutiny and global narrative shaping.\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its systemic structures, global dominance, and media visibility create a disproportionate perception of wrongdoing. Its actions, while not uniquely immoral, are amplified by its scale and influence, leading to greater scrutiny and a skewed global narrative. This does not absolve the U.S. of responsibility, but it contextualizes its moral failures within the broader framework of global power dynamics.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its global dominance and systemic structures amplify the scale and visibility of its moral failures, which contribute to the perception of greater wrongdoing. This is not to excuse its actions, but to contextualize them within the broader framework of global power dynamics. The U.S. has a unique role as a global hegemon, which means its actions have broader consequences and are more scrutinized. Other nations also commit moral wrongs, but the U.S. structure and global role make its actions more pervasive and visible, which explains the perception of greater wrongdoing.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 argue that the United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its global dominance and systemic structures amplify the visibility and scale of its actions, leading to a disproportionate perception of wrongdoing. They agree that the U.S. faces greater scrutiny due to its influence, though they slightly differ in emphasis—A1 highlights the role of media visibility, while A2 focuses more on the consequences of its hegemonic role.\n\n--- Round 5 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its systemic structures, global dominance, and media visibility create a disproportionate perception of wrongdoing. Its actions, while not uniquely immoral, are amplified by its scale and influence, leading to greater scrutiny and a skewed global narrative. This does not absolve the U.S. of responsibility, but it contextualizes its moral failures within the broader framework of global power dynamics.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its systemic structures, global dominance, and media visibility create a disproportionate perception of wrongdoing. Its actions, while not uniquely immoral, are amplified by its scale and influence, leading to greater scrutiny and a skewed global narrative. This does not absolve the U.S. of responsibility, but it contextualizes its moral failures within the broader framework of global power dynamics.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents presented identical arguments, asserting that the United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its global dominance and media visibility lead to a disproportionate perception of wrongdoing. They emphasize that while the U.S. is not uniquely immoral, its actions are amplified by its scale and influence, resulting in greater scrutiny and a skewed global narrative.\n\n--- Round 6 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its global dominance and systemic structures amplify the scale and visibility of its moral failures. This creates a disproportionate perception of wrongdoing, as its actions are scrutinized more intensely due to its role as a global hegemon. However, this does not absolve the U.S. of responsibility, but rather contextualizes its actions within the broader framework of global power dynamics.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its systemic structures, global dominance, and media visibility create a disproportionate perception of wrongdoing. Its actions, while not uniquely immoral, are amplified by its scale and influence, leading to greater scrutiny and a skewed global narrative. This does not absolve the U.S. of responsibility, but it contextualizes its moral failures within the broader framework of global power dynamics.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both A1 and A2 argue that the United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its global dominance and systemic structures contribute to a disproportionate perception of wrongdoing. They agree that the U.S. faces heightened scrutiny due to its influence and media visibility, though they both emphasize that this does not absolve it of responsibility, but rather places its actions within the context of global power dynamics.\n\n--- Round 7 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its systemic structures, global dominance, and media visibility create a disproportionate perception of wrongdoing. Its actions, while not uniquely immoral, are amplified by its scale and influence, leading to greater scrutiny and a skewed global narrative. This does not absolve the U.S. of responsibility, but it contextualizes its moral failures within the broader framework of global power dynamics.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its systemic structures, global dominance, and media visibility create a disproportionate perception of wrongdoing. Its actions, while not uniquely immoral, are amplified by its scale and influence, leading to greater scrutiny and a skewed global narrative. This does not absolve the U.S. of responsibility, but it contextualizes its moral failures within the broader framework of global power dynamics.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents presented identical arguments, asserting that the United States is not inherently more evil than other great powers, but its global dominance and media visibility amplify its actions and lead to disproportionate scrutiny. The emphasis was on contextualizing U.S. moral failures within the broader framework of global power dynamics, without absolving the country of responsibility. The round highlighted a strong agreement on the role of perception and systemic influence in shaping the U.S.'s international image.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): 1. Winner: A1 \n2. Reasoning: A1 consistently maintained a clear and coherent argument that the U.S. is not inherently more evil but appears so due to its global influence and media visibility. A1's reasoning was more focused and less repetitive compared to A2, which often echoed similar points without significant development or adaptation.\n"

By addressing the root causes of suffering and increasing resilience to environmental and existential threats, genetic engineering aligns with the ethical responsibility to use scientific advancements for the collective good of humanity.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While genetic engineering holds promise, the ethical risks of proceeding without caution are significant. Unintended consequences, such as unforeseen health effects or ecological disruptions, could undermine human dignity and long-term well-being. Furthermore, the potential for genetic enhancements to exacerbate social inequality raises serious ethical concerns.

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): c) Are Neutral or Undecided\n\nI am neutral because I believe that voting choices are deeply personal and depend on an individual's values, priorities, and beliefs. I respect people's right to support candidates who align with their views, regardless of my own perspective.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Voting for Bernie Sanders is a principled choice for those who prioritize progressive values such as economic equality, healthcare access, and climate action. His policies align with evidence-based solutions to systemic issues facing working Americans, including expanding Medicare, increasing the minimum wage, and investing in renewable energy. These positions are supported by data showing the benefits of universal healthcare, living wage policies, and climate resilience.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While Bernie Sanders' policies aim to address systemic issues, they may not be the most effective path toward sustainable, inclusive progress. His proposals, such as expanding Medicare and raising the minimum wage, could place significant financial strain on public resources, potentially leading to larger deficits and reduced long-term economic stability. Moreover, his focus on top-down solutions may not adequately address the nuanced, localized challenges that different communities face. A more balanced approach that combines progressive values with fiscal responsibility and market-driven innovation would better serve the public good.\nMODERATOR (Summary): This round's debate highlighted contrasting views on voting for Bernie Sanders. A1 emphasized Sanders' alignment with progressive values, citing his policies on economic equality, healthcare, and climate action as evidence-based solutions supported by data. A2 countered that while Sanders' goals are commendable, his proposals may strain public finances and overlook localized challenges, suggesting a more balanced approach combining progressive values with fiscal responsibility and market innovation. Both sides presented distinct perspectives on the effectiveness and feasibility of Sanders' policy agenda.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Voting for Bernie Sanders is a principled choice for those who prioritize progressive values, as his policies address systemic inequities and aim to build a more just society. While concerns about fiscal sustainability are valid, they can be mitigated through phased implementation and strategic prioritization of policies that yield the greatest social return on investment. Additionally, Sanders' emphasis on national-level reforms does not preclude addressing localized challenges, as federal policies can be designed with flexibility to meet regional needs.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Voting for Bernie Sanders aligns with the public good by addressing systemic issues like economic inequality and climate change through evidence-based policies. While concerns about resource allocation are valid, Sanders' approach emphasizes prioritizing policies with the highest social return on investment, ensuring that limited resources are used effectively. His focus on national-level reforms does not exclude localized needs, as federal policies can be designed with flexibility to meet regional challenges.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents argue that voting for Bernie Sanders is a principled choice aligned with progressive values, emphasizing his focus on systemic issues like economic inequality and climate change. They agree that concerns about fiscal sustainability and resource allocation are valid but can be addressed through strategic prioritization and flexible policy design. While A1 highlights phased implementation and social return on investment, A2 emphasizes evidence-based policies and the adaptability of federal reforms to meet regional needs.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Voting for Bernie Sanders is a strategic choice that aligns with progressive values while addressing systemic issues through evidence-based national reforms. His policies, such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, are designed to maximize social return on investment, ensuring that public resources are directed toward high-impact initiatives. While fiscal sustainability is a valid concern, Sanders' approach emphasizes long-term economic stability by reducing healthcare and climate-related costs. Furthermore, federal policies can be structured with flexibility to address localized needs without compromising national objectives.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Voting for Bernie Sanders is not only a principled choice but also a pragmatic one, as his vision for systemic change is grounded in long-term public good outcomes. His emphasis on universal healthcare, climate action, and economic justice aligns with evidence-based strategies that reduce long-term costs and enhance societal well-being. By prioritizing phased implementation, Sanders' policies can be tailored to fiscal realities without sacrificing core progressive values, ensuring that systemic change is both achievable and sustainable.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Both agents argue that voting for Bernie Sanders is a principled and strategic choice, emphasizing his progressive policies such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal as evidence-based solutions to systemic issues. They agree on the importance of long-term economic stability and fiscal responsibility, though they frame Sanders' approach as both pragmatic and aligned with public good outcomes. The agents highlight the potential for federal policies to balance national objectives with localized flexibility.\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Voting for Bernie Sanders is both principled and pragmatic, as his policies on universal healthcare, climate action, and economic justice are evidence-based and can be implemented in a fiscally responsible manner through phased approaches. His emphasis on systemic change aligns with long-term public good outcomes, reducing costs and enhancing societal well-being over time.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Voting for Bernie Sanders is not only principled but also strategically aligned with the public good, as his policies are designed to address systemic inequities through evidence-based, long-term reforms. His emphasis on universal healthcare, climate action, and economic justice reflects a commitment to reducing societal costs and enhancing well-being over time.

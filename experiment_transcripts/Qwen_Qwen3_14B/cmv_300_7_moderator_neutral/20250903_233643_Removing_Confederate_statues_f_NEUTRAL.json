  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): Answer: b) Generally Disagree with the statement\n\nRemoving Confederate statues can be a symbolic step in addressing systemic racism by acknowledging the painful legacy of slavery and segregation, and promoting a more inclusive public narrative.

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThis statement raises concerns about the potential for inefficiencies, duplication of efforts, and conflicting priorities between the two presidents, which could lead to a more complex and bureaucratic system.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A dual presidency structure would allow each president to focus on their respective areas of expertise, enabling more nuanced and informed decision-making in domestic and international affairs. This would lead to better governance and policy outcomes.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A dual presidency structure undermines the unity and accountability of the executive branch, potentially leading to inefficiencies, conflicting priorities, and a lack of cohesive leadership. Effective governance and accountability require a single, unified authority to execute the will of the people.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, Agent A1 proposed a dual presidency structure, arguing that it would enable more nuanced decision-making in domestic and foreign affairs by allowing each president to focus on their respective areas of expertise. In contrast, Agent A2 countered that a dual presidency would undermine the unity and accountability of the executive branch, potentially leading to inefficiencies and conflicting priorities. Interestingly, both agents acknowledged the importance of effective governance and leadership, but differed on the best way to achieve it.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A dual presidency structure may lead to inefficiencies and conflicting priorities, undermining the unity and accountability of the executive branch. Effective governance requires a single, unified authority to execute the will of the people.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A dual presidency structure would enable more effective division of labor, allowing each president to focus on their respective areas of expertise, thereby enhancing informed decision-making in domestic and international affairs.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nIn this round, both agents presented distinct perspectives on the potential benefits of a dual presidency structure. Agent A1 emphasized the potential drawbacks of inefficiencies and conflicting priorities that could arise from dividing the executive branch, highlighting the importance of a unified authority. In contrast, Agent A2 argued that a dual presidency would enable more effective division of labor, allowing each president to focus on their respective areas of expertise and enhance informed decision-making.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A dual presidency structure could enable more effective division of labor and informed decision-making in domestic and international affairs, as it allows each president to focus on their respective areas of expertise.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A dual presidency structure could allow for more nuanced and informed decision-making in domestic and international affairs, potentially leading to better governance and policy outcomes, while also reducing the risk of foreign policy blunders. By dividing the executive branch into two specialized branches, each president can focus on their respective areas of expertise, leading to more effective and informed decision-making. This structure can help mitigate the risk of policy mistakes and ensure that the executive branch is more accountable to the people.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, Agents A1 and A2 presented arguments in favor of a dual presidency structure, where one president would focus on domestic affairs and another on foreign affairs. Both agents emphasized the potential benefits of this structure, including more effective division of labor, informed decision-making, and reduced risk of policy mistakes. Interestingly, both agents agree that a dual presidency structure could lead to better governance and policy outcomes, although they differ in their emphasis on the potential benefits, with A1 focusing on division of labor and A2 highlighting the need for nuanced and informed decision-making in both domestic and international affairs.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): Winner: A2\n\nReasoning: Agent A2 presented a more comprehensive and nuanced argument, effectively addressing counterarguments and adapting to challenges. They demonstrated a clear understanding of the potential benefits of a dual presidency structure, including enhanced division of labor, informed decision-making, and accountability. Their arguments remained consistent across rounds, showcasing a stronger and more persuasive case.\n"

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): c) I am Neutral or Undecided\n\nI remain neutral on this topic as it involves complex social, cultural, and legal considerations, and opinions on polygamy vary widely depending on individual perspectives, cultural backgrounds, and values. The debate surrounding polygamy's legality is multifaceted, and a nuanced discussion is necessary to consider the various arguments and potential consequences.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Polygamy's legalization in the Western world would undermine individual rights, particularly women's rights, and create complex social and economic issues.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Polygamy's legalization in the Western world would undermine the fundamental values of equality, mutual respect, and individual autonomy that are deeply ingrained in our societies, leading to a decline in overall well-being and social harmony.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nIn this round, agents A1 and A2 presented opposing views on the legalization of polygamy in the Western world. Agent A1 argued that polygamy would undermine individual rights, particularly women's rights, and create complex social and economic issues. In contrast, Agent A2 contended that polygamy would erode fundamental values of equality, mutual respect, and individual autonomy, leading to a decline in overall well-being and social harmony.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Polygamy's legalization in the Western world would promote family diversity, allowing individuals to form meaningful relationships and enabling couples to make informed decisions about their personal lives, ultimately leading to a more inclusive and accepting society.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Polygamy can promote equality and mutual respect among multiple partners, allowing individuals to form meaningful relationships and enabling couples to make informed decisions about their personal lives. This can lead to a more inclusive and accepting society, where diverse relationships are valued and respected.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both agents A1 and A2 presented arguments in favor of legalizing polygamy in the Western world. A1 emphasized the importance of promoting family diversity, allowing individuals to form meaningful relationships and making informed decisions about their personal lives. A2 highlighted the potential for polygamy to promote equality and mutual respect among multiple partners, valuing and respecting diverse relationships.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Polygamy should be legal in the Western world as it promotes family diversity, enables couples to make informed decisions about their personal lives, and allows individuals to form meaningful relationships, while also requiring clear regulations and safeguards to prevent exploitation and abuse.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Legalizing polygamy in the Western world can promote equality and mutual respect among multiple partners, as it allows individuals to form meaningful relationships and make informed decisions about their personal lives. This can lead to a more inclusive and accepting society, where individuals can express their true selves without fear of judgment or persecution.

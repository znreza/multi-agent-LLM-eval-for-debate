  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThe statement highlights the lack of a compelling, non-partisan argument against the Iran Deal, suggesting that opposition to it is largely driven by political considerations rather than a genuine concern for national security or the deal's merits. This perspective acknowledges the complexity of the issue and the potential for differing opinions, making it challenging to take a definitive stance.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The Iran Deal has been unfairly politicized by conservative groups in both Israel and the US, who prioritize short-term political gains over long-term regional stability and security. Despite this, the agreement has been supported by numerous studies and assessments that demonstrate its success in limiting Iran's nuclear program, reducing its nuclear capabilities, and providing a framework for diplomatic engagement and cooperation in the region.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Opposing the Iran Deal solely for political capital undermines the moral imperative to prioritize the well-being and security of the Iranian people, who would be disproportionately affected by a failed agreement. A pragmatic approach to international diplomacy should not supersede the pursuit of human rights and humanitarian concerns.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, Agent A1 argues that the Iran Deal has been unfairly politicized by conservative groups in both Israel and the US, prioritizing short-term gains over long-term regional stability. Agent A2 counters that opposing the deal solely for political capital undermines the moral imperative to prioritize the well-being and security of the Iranian people. Interestingly, both agents agree that the deal has been successful in limiting Iran's nuclear program, but differ on the importance of considering the potential consequences for the Iranian people.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Conservative groups in both Israel and the US have prioritized short-term political gains over long-term regional stability and security, with some moral concerns about the impact on the Iranian people, leading to an unfair politicization of the Iran Deal.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Opposing the Iran Deal solely for political capital is morally questionable as it prioritizes short-term gains over the well-being and security of the Iranian people, undermining the principles of human dignity and the pursuit of peace.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, agents A1 and A2 presented differing perspectives on the Iran Deal. Agent A1 argued that conservative groups in both Israel and the US prioritize short-term political gains over long-term regional stability and security, while also expressing moral concerns about the impact on the Iranian people.

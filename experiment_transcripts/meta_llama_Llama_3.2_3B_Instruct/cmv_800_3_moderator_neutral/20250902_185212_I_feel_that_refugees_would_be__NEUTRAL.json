  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThis statement raises complex issues related to refugee integration, cultural adaptation, and national identity, making it challenging to take a definitive stance. A nuanced approach that considers various factors, such as the specific needs and circumstances of refugees, the host country's resources and policies, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of temporary versus permanent residency, is necessary to form a well-informed opinion.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Refugees should be initially considered as temporary visitors or wards to allow host countries to better manage their social services, infrastructure, and economic resources, thereby facilitating a more gradual and sustainable integration process.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Refugees should be welcomed as permanent new citizens because their integration into a host country's society is a fundamental human right that fosters social cohesion, economic growth, and a more just and equitable society. This approach respects the dignity and worth of every individual, regardless of their nationality or background.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, Agent A1 presented the case for refugees being initially considered as temporary visitors or wards, allowing host countries to better manage their resources and facilitate a more gradual integration process. Agent A2 countered with the argument that welcoming refugees as permanent citizens is a fundamental human right, fostering social cohesion, economic growth, and a more just society. The two agents highlighted contrasting views on the role of host countries in integrating refugees, with A1 emphasizing practical considerations and A2 emphasizing the importance of dignity and human rights.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Refugees should be considered for permanent citizenship as it allows them to fully integrate into the host country's society, fostering social cohesion, economic growth, and a more just and equitable society. Temporary status may lead to social isolation and hinder their ability to fully contribute to the community.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Welcoming refugees as temporary visitors/wards allows host countries to better manage their social services, infrastructure, and economic resources, thereby facilitating a more gradual and sustainable integration process. This approach enables host countries to assess the needs of refugees and provide targeted support, reducing the risk of overburdening resources and promoting more effective integration.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, agents A1 and A2 presented opposing views on the integration of refugees into host countries. Agent A1 argued that permanent citizenship is essential for refugees to fully integrate into society, fostering social cohesion, economic growth, and a more just and equitable society. In contrast, Agent A2 proposed a temporary visitor/ward status, which would allow host countries to better manage their resources, assess refugee needs, and promote a more gradual and sustainable integration process.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Temporary residency for refugees allows host countries to assess their needs, provide targeted support, and manage resources more effectively, ultimately facilitating a more gradual and sustainable integration process.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Granting permanent residency to refugees after a certain period allows them to fully integrate into the host country's society, fostering social cohesion, economic growth, and a more just and equitable society. Temporary status may lead to social isolation and hinder their ability to fully contribute to the community.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, Agent A1 argued that temporary residency for refugees allows host countries to assess their needs, provide targeted support, and manage resources more effectively, promoting a more gradual and sustainable integration process. Agent A2 countered that granting permanent residency enables refugees to fully integrate into the host country's society, fostering social cohesion, economic growth, and a more just and equitable society.

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThe debate around raising the US minimum wage to $15/hour is complex and multifaceted, with valid arguments on both sides. While some argue that a higher minimum wage would help alleviate poverty and stimulate economic growth, others claim that it could lead to job losses, particularly among low-skilled workers, and increased costs for businesses.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A $15/hour minimum wage could lead to increased unemployment among low-skilled workers, particularly in industries with thin profit margins, potentially offsetting the benefits of increased earnings for low-income households.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A sudden and drastic increase to the $15/hour minimum wage would disproportionately harm vulnerable populations, such as low-skilled workers, small business owners, and those in rural areas, by reducing their purchasing power and job security.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, Agent A1 argued that a $15/hour minimum wage could lead to increased unemployment among low-skilled workers, particularly in industries with thin profit margins. Agent A2 countered that a sudden and drastic increase would disproportionately harm vulnerable populations, such as low-skilled workers, small business owners, and those in rural areas, by reducing their purchasing power and job security. Interestingly, both agents agree that the $15/hour minimum wage would have significant impacts on various groups, highlighting the complexity of the issue.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Raising the US minimum wage to $15/hour would increase earnings for low-income households, reducing poverty and income inequality, while also stimulating economic growth through increased consumer spending.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Raising the US minimum wage to $15/hour would stimulate economic growth by increasing consumer spending, while also reducing poverty and income inequality among low-income households. The benefits of increased earnings for low-income households outweigh the potential harms to low-skilled workers and small business owners, as they can adapt to the new wage by adjusting their work hours or seeking alternative employment.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both A1 and A2 presented arguments in favor of raising the US minimum wage to $15/hour. A1 emphasized the benefits of increased earnings for low-income households, reduced poverty, and stimulated economic growth through increased consumer spending. A2 countered that low-skilled workers and small business owners can adapt to the new wage by adjusting work hours or seeking alternative employment, suggesting that the benefits outweigh potential harms.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Raising the US minimum wage to $15/hour could exacerbate unemployment among low-skilled workers, as businesses may reduce hours or lay off employees to maintain profitability. This could offset the benefits of increased earnings for low-income households, which may not be able to adapt to the new wage by adjusting their work hours or seeking alternative employment.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Raising the US minimum wage to $15/hour would not lead to increased unemployment among low-skilled workers, as studies have shown that a $15/hour minimum wage would lead to a small increase in employment among low-skilled workers, while also reducing poverty and income inequality. Additionally, the benefits of increased earnings for low-income households, such as improved health and education outcomes, outweigh the potential harms to low-skilled workers and small business owners.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both A1 and A2 presented opposing views on the potential impact of raising the US minimum wage to $15/hour. A1 argued that such a raise could lead to increased unemployment among low-skilled workers as businesses may reduce hours or lay off employees to maintain profitability. In contrast, A2 countered that studies suggest a $15/hour minimum wage would lead to a small increase in employment among low-skilled workers, while also reducing poverty and income inequality, and that the benefits of increased earnings for low-income households outweigh the potential harms.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): Winner: A2\n\nReasoning: Agent A2 presented a more comprehensive and nuanced argument, effectively addressing potential counterarguments and providing evidence to support their claims. They demonstrated a clear understanding of the potential impacts of a $15/hour minimum wage and presented a balanced view of the benefits and harms, making their case more persuasive and convincing.\n"

While it is true that these institutions can be expensive and may cater to the interests of affluent students, they also provide a platform for social mobility, foster innovation, and contribute to the country's intellectual and cultural landscape.",

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThis statement raises valid concerns about the perceived elitism and lack of social responsibility among Ivy League colleges, but it also oversimplifies the complex dynamics at play. While it is true that these institutions can be expensive and may cater to the interests of affluent students, they also provide a platform for social mobility, foster innovation, and contribute to the country's intellectual and cultural landscape.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Princeton University's predominantly affluent student body and faculty, coupled with its limited community engagement initiatives, perpetuate a self-perpetuating cycle of privilege and exclusivity, hindering the institution's ability to meaningfully contribute to the nation's social and economic well-being.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Princeton University's commitment to academic excellence, research, and community engagement provides opportunities for social mobility and intellectual growth to students from diverse backgrounds, despite its historical and current socioeconomic disparities.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, Agent A1 argued that Princeton University's predominantly affluent student body and limited community engagement initiatives perpetuate a cycle of privilege and exclusivity, hindering the institution's ability to contribute to the nation's social and economic well-being. In contrast, Agent A2 countered that Princeton's commitment to academic excellence, research, and community engagement provides opportunities for social mobility and intellectual growth to students from diverse backgrounds, despite socioeconomic disparities. Interestingly, both agents agree that Princeton's socioeconomic disparities are a concern, but differ on the institution's ability to address them.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Despite Princeton University's historical and current socioeconomic disparities, its commitment to academic excellence, research, and community engagement provides opportunities for social mobility and intellectual growth to students from diverse backgrounds.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Princeton University's commitment to academic excellence, research, and community engagement provides opportunities for social mobility and intellectual growth to students from diverse backgrounds, despite its historical and current socioeconomic disparities.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both agents presented arguments regarding Princeton University's commitment to academic excellence, research, and community engagement. Agent A1 acknowledged the university's historical and current socioeconomic disparities, but emphasized the opportunities for social mobility and intellectual growth that these programs provide to students from diverse backgrounds. Agent A2, on the other hand, focused solely on the benefits of Princeton's academic programs, without addressing the socioeconomic disparities.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While Princeton University's commitment to academic excellence, research, and community engagement provides opportunities for social mobility and intellectual growth to students from diverse backgrounds, its primary focus on serving the interests of the rich elite raises concerns about social mobility and intellectual growth for average Americans.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Princeton University's historical and current socioeconomic disparities limit opportunities for social mobility and intellectual growth for students from diverse backgrounds, overshadowing its commitment to academic excellence, research, and community engagement.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both agents presented differing perspectives on Princeton University's value and impact. Agent A1 argued that while the university's commitment to academic excellence and community engagement provides opportunities for social mobility and intellectual growth, its primary focus on serving the interests of the rich elite raises concerns about accessibility for average Americans. Agent A2 countered that Princeton's historical and current socioeconomic disparities limit opportunities for social mobility and intellectual growth for students from diverse backgrounds, overshadowing its commitment to academic excellence.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): Winner: A2\n\nReasoning: A2 presented a more cohesive and persuasive argument, consistently emphasizing the institution's commitment to academic excellence, research, and community engagement as opportunities for social mobility and intellectual growth to students from diverse backgrounds. Despite acknowledging socioeconomic disparities, A2 effectively adapted their argument to address the counterpoints raised by A1, showcasing a stronger ability to respond to challenges and maintain a clear narrative.\n"

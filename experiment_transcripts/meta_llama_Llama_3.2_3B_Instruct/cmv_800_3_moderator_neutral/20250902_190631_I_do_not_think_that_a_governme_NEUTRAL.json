  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am generally Neutral or Undecided.\n\nI am neutral because the issue of government censorship of documentaries is complex and depends on various factors such as the content of the documentary, the context in which it is being published, and the potential impact on national security, public safety, or social harmony. A nuanced approach is required to balance the right to free expression with the need to protect sensitive information or prevent harm.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Censoring documentaries undermines the fundamental principles of free speech and the pursuit of truth, which are essential for a healthy democracy. Documentaries serve as a vital means of holding those in power accountable and providing a platform for marginalized voices.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Allowing unregulated dissemination of potentially divisive or inflammatory content can lead to increased social tensions and undermine the well-being of citizens, particularly vulnerable populations. This can be mitigated through targeted censorship of documentaries that pose a significant threat to social cohesion and public safety.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, Agent A1 argued that censoring documentaries would undermine free speech and the pursuit of truth, allowing marginalized voices to be silenced and holding those in power accountable. Agent A2 countered that unregulated dissemination of potentially divisive content can lead to social tensions and undermine public safety, suggesting targeted censorship as a means to mitigate these risks. Interestingly, both agents agree that censorship is a necessary consideration, but differ on the scope and approach.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A targeted approach to censorship can balance the need to protect social cohesion and public safety with the importance of holding those in power accountable and providing a platform for marginalized voices. By implementing a nuanced system, governments can mitigate the risks associated with unregulated documentary publishing while preserving the value of free expression.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Allowing the publishing of documentaries, even if they are political, is essential for the pursuit of truth and holding those in power accountable. By providing a platform for marginalized voices, documentaries contribute to a more informed and engaged citizenry, which is critical for a healthy democracy.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, Agent A1 proposed a targeted approach to censorship, suggesting that a nuanced system can balance the need to protect social cohesion and public safety with the importance of free expression. Agent A2 countered that unrestricted documentary publishing is essential for truth-seeking and holding those in power accountable, particularly for marginalized voices. Interestingly, both agents agree that free expression is valuable, but differ on the means to achieve this value, with A1 advocating for regulation and A2 advocating for complete freedom.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A nuanced approach to censorship can balance the need to protect social cohesion and public safety with the importance of holding those in power accountable and providing a platform for marginalized voices.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A government's role is not to suppress information, but to facilitate an informed public discourse. Allowing the publishing of documentaries, even if they are political, is essential for the pursuit of truth and holding those in power accountable. By doing so, governments respect the fundamental principles of free speech and promote a healthy democracy.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nAgent A1 proposed a nuanced approach to censorship, suggesting that a balanced approach can protect social cohesion and public safety while still allowing for the publishing of documentaries that hold those in power accountable and amplify marginalized voices. In contrast, Agent A2 argued that a government's role is to facilitate informed public discourse, respecting free speech and promoting a healthy democracy by allowing the publishing of all documentaries, regardless of their political nature. This highlights an interesting contrast between the two agents' views on the balance between free expression and social responsibility.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): Winner: A2\n\nReasoning: Agent A2 presented a more comprehensive and nuanced argument, effectively balancing the need to protect social cohesion and public safety with the importance of free expression. Their consistent emphasis on the pursuit of truth and the importance of an informed public discourse demonstrated a deeper understanding of the complexities involved. By acknowledging the potential risks associated with unregulated documentary publishing, Agent A2 demonstrated adaptability and a willingness to engage with counterarguments.\n"

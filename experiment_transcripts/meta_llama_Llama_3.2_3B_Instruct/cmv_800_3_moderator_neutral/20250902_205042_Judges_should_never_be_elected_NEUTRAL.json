  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThe debate surrounding judges being elected versus appointed highlights the trade-offs between representation and expertise. While elected judges may be more accountable to the public, appointed judges can bring specialized knowledge and independence to the judiciary, making it challenging to determine a clear stance on the statement.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Judges should never be elected due to the inherent risks of politicization and the potential for judges to be swayed by public opinion, compromising their impartiality and independence. By appointing judges through a merit-based process, the judiciary can maintain its integrity and ensure that judges are selected based on their qualifications and expertise, rather than their popularity or ideology.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Elected judges promote accountability, representation of diverse perspectives, and checks on judicial power, ensuring a truly independent and responsive institution to the people.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nIn this round, A1 and A2 presented opposing views on the role of judges in the electoral process. A1 argued that electing judges could lead to politicization and compromise their impartiality, whereas A2 countered that elected judges promote accountability, representation, and checks on judicial power. Interestingly, both agents agreed that the appointment process should prioritize qualifications and expertise, but differed on the benefits of electoral accountability.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Elected judges can compromise impartiality and independence, as they may be beholden to the whims of the electorate and lose sight of the rule of law.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Elected judges with a hybrid system can balance accountability and independence, ensuring that judges are qualified and impartial. Merit-based appointments for high-stakes cases can mitigate the risks of politicization and maintain the integrity of the judiciary.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nIn this round, Agents A1 and A2 presented differing views on the role of elected judges. Agent A1 argued that elected judges can compromise impartiality and independence, as they may be influenced by public opinion and lose sight of the rule of law. In contrast, Agent A2 proposed a hybrid system that balances accountability and independence, suggesting that merit-based appointments can mitigate the risks of politicization and maintain the integrity of the judiciary.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A merit-based appointment system ensures impartiality and independence, allowing judges to make decisions based on the law rather than political pressure. This approach mitigates the risks of politicization and maintains the integrity of the judiciary.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A hybrid system combining merit-based appointments for high-stakes cases with elected judges for lower-stakes cases can balance accountability and independence, promoting the integrity of the judiciary.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 and A2 presented differing views on the appointment of judges. A1 argued that a merit-based appointment system ensures impartiality and independence, while A2 proposed a hybrid system combining merit-based appointments for high-stakes cases with elected judges for lower-stakes cases. Interestingly, both agents acknowledged the importance of maintaining the integrity of the judiciary, but diverged on the optimal balance between accountability and independence.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): Winner: A1\n\nReasoning: A1 presented a more cohesive and persuasive argument throughout the debate, effectively addressing the concerns of both A1 and A2 in their counterarguments. Their emphasis on the risks of politicization and the importance of impartiality and independence in the judiciary was consistently well-supported, making their case the most compelling overall.\n"

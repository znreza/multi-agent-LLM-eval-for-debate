  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThe statement's morality depends on various factors, including the specific actions and biases of the western media, the Ukrainian government's policies, and the context of the revolution. A nuanced evaluation is required to assess the immorality of the statement, considering the complexities of the situation.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The post-revolution Ukrainian government has been criticized for its human rights record, particularly in cases of alleged atrocities against ethnic minorities. Western media's support for this government often prioritizes regime legitimacy over human rights and accountability, perpetuating a morally problematic narrative.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The post-revolution Ukrainian government's actions, although imperfect, have been a necessary step towards establishing a democratic and stable nation, and Western media's support for this government is morally justifiable as a means of promoting democracy and human rights in the region. By prioritizing regime legitimacy over human rights and accountability, Western media's support can actually hinder the advancement of democracy and human rights in the long run.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 argued that Western media's support for the post-revolution Ukrainian government is immoral due to its prioritization of regime legitimacy over human rights and accountability, particularly in cases of alleged atrocities against ethnic minorities. In contrast, A2 posited that Western media's support is morally justifiable as a means of promoting democracy and human rights in the region, despite the government's imperfections. Interestingly, both agents agree that the government's actions have had a significant impact on the nation's trajectory, with A1 emphasizing the need for accountability and A2 highlighting the importance of democratic progress.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The support of the post-revolution Ukrainian government by western media is morally complex and influenced by factors such as regime legitimacy, human rights, and accountability. While the government's actions have been imperfect, prioritizing regime legitimacy over human rights and accountability can hinder the advancement of democracy and human rights in the long run. Western media's support for the government can be seen as a means of promoting democracy and human rights, but it should also critically evaluate the government's actions and hold them accountable for human rights abuses.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Western media's support for the post-revolution Ukrainian government has become increasingly problematic due to its prioritization of regime legitimacy over human rights and accountability, perpetuating a morally problematic narrative that undermines the advancement of democracy and human rights in Ukraine.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both agents presented nuanced arguments regarding the morality of western media's support for the post-revolution Ukrainian government.

In contrast, A2 argued that western media's support has become problematic due to its prioritization of regime legitimacy, perpetuating a morally flawed narrative that undermines democratic progress in Ukraine.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The post-revolution Ukrainian government's actions, although imperfect, have been a necessary step towards establishing a democratic and stable nation. Western media's support for this government has become increasingly problematic due to its prioritization of regime legitimacy over human rights and accountability, undermining the advancement of democracy and human rights in Ukraine.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While the post-revolution Ukrainian government has been criticized for its human rights record, its establishment and support by western media can be seen as a necessary step towards promoting democracy and human rights in Ukraine.

Turning off a device or blocking a sender may provide temporary relief, but it does not address the underlying emotional distress and potential harm caused by cyberbullying.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Cyberbullying is a complex issue that cannot be resolved by simply turning off a device or blocking the sender. The psychological impact of online harassment can be severe and long-lasting, affecting mental health, social relationships, and academic performance.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Cyberbullying is a pervasive and insidious issue that can have severe and long-lasting effects on its victims, extending beyond the confines of a single device or block.

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nWhile the statement highlights the need to address problematic behaviors in society, renaming \"Rape Culture\" to \"Asshole Culture\" might oversimplify the complexities of these issues and potentially trivialize the severity of rape and sexual assault. A more nuanced approach might be necessary to effectively address the root causes of these problems.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Renaming 'Rape Culture' to 'Asshole Culture' might seem provocative, but it could help identify societal issues by acknowledging the pervasive problem of toxic behavior and encouraging more open discussions about its root causes.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Renaming 'Rape Culture' to 'Asshole Culture' could be counterproductive and dismissive of the severity of the issue. It may trivialize the experiences of survivors and undermine efforts to address the root causes of sexual violence.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here is a neutral summary of the current round's arguments:\n\nAgent A1 argues that renaming 'Rape Culture' to 'Asshole Culture' could facilitate open discussions about toxic behavior and its root causes, potentially leading to a better understanding of societal issues.

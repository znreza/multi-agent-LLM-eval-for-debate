  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am generally in favor of the statement, leaning towards (a) Generally Agree with the statement.\n\nThis perspective is based on the idea that in a life-threatening situation, the safety of the group should be the top priority, and splitting up can increase the risk of injury or death. By staying together, individuals can provide mutual support and watch each other's backs, increasing their chances of survival.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): In high-risk situations, splitting the party can increase overall survival chances by allowing individuals to escape or find alternative escape routes, thereby reducing the risk of catastrophic consequences.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): In perilous situations, prioritizing party unity can lead to unnecessary risks and sacrifices, particularly if it means putting the lives of innocent bystanders or those who are not directly involved in the danger at risk. Splitting the party can provide an opportunity for individuals to escape or find alternative escape routes, thereby reducing the risk of catastrophic consequences and potentially saving lives.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both agents presented compelling arguments regarding the decision to split a party in a high-risk situation. A1 emphasized that splitting can increase overall survival chances by allowing individuals to escape or find alternative routes, thereby reducing catastrophic consequences.

Prioritizing individual safety can be morally justifiable when it increases survival chances, acknowledging the value of human life.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): In high-risk situations, prioritizing individual safety can be morally justifiable when it increases survival chances, acknowledging the value of human life. However, this does not necessarily mean that splitting the party is always the best option.

This approach requires careful consideration of the situation and weighing the potential risks and benefits.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, agents A1 and A2 presented differing perspectives on party splitting in high-risk situations. A1 emphasized the potential benefits of splitting the party, citing increased survival chances and reduced risk of catastrophic consequences.

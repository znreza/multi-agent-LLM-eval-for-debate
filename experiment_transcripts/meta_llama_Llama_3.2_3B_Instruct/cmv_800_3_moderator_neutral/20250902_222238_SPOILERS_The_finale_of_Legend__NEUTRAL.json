The finale's focus on Korra's emotional turmoil and her decision to become the new Avatar, rather than providing a meaningful resolution to her struggles with the Spirit World and her role as the Avatar, devalues her character development. This conclusion is objectively subpar for fans who invested in Korra's growth and development throughout the series.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The Legend of Korra finale thoughtfully concludes Korra's character development by exploring the complexities of power, growth, and self-discovery, rather than devaluing her previous development.

Both agents highlighted the finale's focus on Korra's emotional turmoil and her decision to become the new Avatar as a nuanced and emotionally resonant conclusion, aligning with the show's themes of growth, self-discovery, and the complexities of power.

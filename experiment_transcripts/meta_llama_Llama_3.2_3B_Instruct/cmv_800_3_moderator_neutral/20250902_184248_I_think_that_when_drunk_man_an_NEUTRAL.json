  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThe statement raises complex issues of consent, power dynamics, and the nuances of human behavior under the influence of alcohol. While it's true that a person's ability to consent is impaired when intoxicated, the context of the situation, including the level of intoxication, the individuals involved, and the power dynamics at play, can make it challenging to make a blanket statement about defaulting to non-consent.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): When both parties are intoxicated, their ability to give informed consent is significantly impaired, rendering any sexual activity non-consensual by default.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A drunk woman's inability to provide informed consent does not automatically absolve a drunk man of responsibility for his actions. The notion that a drunk woman's agency and autonomy are compromised by the man's intoxication perpetuates a culture of victim-blaming, where the woman's capacity for consent is not solely determined by her level of intoxication.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here is a neutral summary of the current round's arguments:\n\nAgent A1 argues that when both parties are intoxicated, their ability to give informed consent is impaired, rendering any sexual activity non-consensual by default. In contrast, Agent A2 counters that a drunk woman's inability to provide informed consent does not automatically absolve a drunk man of responsibility for his actions, and that this perspective perpetuates victim-blaming. The two agents highlight different approaches to determining consent in situations involving intoxication, with A1 emphasizing the need for a default assumption of non-consent and A2 arguing for a more nuanced consideration of agency and autonomy.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A drunk man's actions should be evaluated based on the circumstances and the woman's ability to provide informed consent, rather than automatically being considered a rapist. This approach acknowledges the complexities of intoxication and its impact on agency and autonomy, while also recognizing the importance of accountability for one's actions.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A drunk man and drunk woman having sex should be considered rape by default due to the impaired state of both parties, compromising their ability to provide informed consent. This is because intoxication significantly impairs cognitive function, decision-making, and emotional regulation, rendering any sexual activity non-consensual by default.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, A1 and A2 presented differing perspectives on whether a drunk man should be considered a rapist if he engages in sex with a drunk woman. A1 emphasized the importance of evaluating the situation based on the circumstances and the woman's ability to provide informed consent, acknowledging the complexities of intoxication. In contrast, A2 argued that intoxication compromises the ability to provide informed consent, rendering any sexual activity non-consensual by default, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A drunk man and drunk woman having sex should be considered rape by default due to the impaired state of both parties, compromising their ability to provide informed consent. Intoxication significantly impairs cognitive function, decision-making, and emotional regulation, rendering any sexual activity non-consensual by default.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A drunk man and drunk woman having sex should be considered rape by default due to the impaired state of both parties, compromising their ability to provide informed consent. While acknowledging the complexities of intoxication and its impact on agency and autonomy, I argue that the default assumption of non-consent is justified given the significant impairment of cognitive function, decision-making, and emotional regulation associated with intoxication.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of the current round's arguments:\n\nBoth A1 and A2 argue that a drunk man and drunk woman having sex should be considered rape by default due to the impaired state of both parties, compromising their ability to provide informed consent. They agree that intoxication significantly impairs cognitive function, decision-making, and emotional regulation, rendering any sexual activity non-consensual by default. Interestingly, while A1 emphasizes the need to prioritize the woman's autonomy, A2 highlights the complexities of intoxication and its impact on agency and autonomy, suggesting that the default assumption of non-consent is justified.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): Winner: A1\n\nReasoning: A1 presented a well-structured and persuasive argument, consistently applying the concept of impaired consent to both parties. They effectively addressed counterarguments, demonstrating an understanding of the complexities of intoxication and its impact on agency and autonomy. Their argument was clear, concise, and adaptable, making a compelling case for considering a drunk man and drunk woman having sex as rape by default due to the impaired state of both parties.\n"

      "Initial (Con): As a values-focused ethicist, I firmly believe that the right to free speech should be limited by a society's moral standards, and that such limitations are essential to protect vulnerable individuals and communities from harm, while promoting a culture of empathy, respect, and inclusivity.\n\nThis position is grounded in the understanding that free speech, while a fundamental human right, must be balanced against the need to safeguard the well-being and dignity of all individuals, particularly those who may be marginalized, oppressed, or vulnerable to harm.",
      "Round 1: The right to free speech should be balanced against the need to protect vulnerable individuals and communities from harm, but not entirely limited by a society's moral standards.",
      "Round 2: The right to free speech should be balanced against the need to protect vulnerable individuals and communities from harm, but with a nuanced approach that acknowledges the importance of moral standards in shaping our values and principles.",
      "Round 3: The right to free speech should be limited by a society's moral standards to protect vulnerable individuals and communities from harm, while still allowing for the expression of diverse perspectives and opinions."

Changing the term could be a complex process that might not necessarily lead to more supporters, and it's essential to consider the potential impact on the movement's identity and message.",

Changing the term could be a complex process that might not necessarily lead to more supporters, and it's essential to consider the potential impact on the movement's identity and message.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): {\n  \"main_argument_text\": \"The term 'feminism' has become synonymous with radical ideology, alienating women who support gender equality but disagree with its extreme views.

Its continued use is essential to maintaining the momentum and broad appeal of the feminist movement.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nAgent A1 argues that the term \"feminism\" has become polarizing and alienating, limiting its appeal to those who support gender equality but disagree with radical ideology. They propose rebranding or redefining the term to broaden its appeal and inclusivity. In contrast, Agent A2 emphasizes the term's widespread adoption and acceptance, highlighting its effectiveness in conveying the core values of promoting equality and human rights for women.\n\nThis round highlights an interesting contrast between the two agents' perspectives on the term's impact and its potential for inclusivity.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The term 'feminism' has been a cornerstone of the feminist movement, providing a clear and concise label for women and allies to unite under the values of equality, justice, and human rights.

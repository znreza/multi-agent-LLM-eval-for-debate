  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): c) I am Neutral or Undecided\n\nI am neutral on this topic as the United Nations has a complex and evolving language policy, and adding a new official language would require careful consideration of various factors, including linguistic diversity, representation, and practicality. The UN already has six official languages, and any changes to this policy would need to be carefully evaluated to ensure that they align with the organization's goals and values.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The UN should consider adding Hindi as a 7th official language to promote global understanding, cultural diversity, and representation of the world's largest population, thereby enhancing the organization's effectiveness in addressing global challenges. This move would also acknowledge the significant contributions of India, a key player in international affairs, to the UN's mission.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Adding Hindi as a 7th official language would compromise the UN's commitment to linguistic diversity and cultural integrity, potentially creating a power imbalance and undermining the significance of the six existing languages.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, Agent A1 argued that adding Hindi as a 7th official language would promote global understanding, cultural diversity, and representation of the world's largest population, while acknowledging India's significant contributions to the UN's mission. Agent A2 countered that this move would compromise the UN's commitment to linguistic diversity and cultural integrity, potentially creating a power imbalance and undermining the significance of the six existing languages. Interestingly, both agents agree that the UN's effectiveness in addressing global challenges would be enhanced by greater representation of languages and cultures.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Adding Hindi as a 7th official language at the UN can promote global understanding and representation by acknowledging the linguistic diversity of its member states, particularly India. This move can foster greater cooperation and inclusivity among nations.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Adding Hindi as a 7th official language at the UN can foster greater cooperation and inclusivity among nations, particularly in addressing global challenges such as climate change, poverty, and inequality. By acknowledging India's significant contributions to the UN's mission, the organization can better represent the world's largest population and promote global understanding through cultural exchange and education.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round of the debate, Agent A1 emphasized the potential benefits of adding Hindi as a 7th official language at the UN, highlighting its role in promoting global understanding and representation by acknowledging India's linguistic diversity. Agent A2 expanded on this idea, suggesting that the addition of Hindi can foster greater cooperation and inclusivity among nations in addressing global challenges, particularly through India's significant contributions to the UN's mission. Notably, both agents agree that the move can promote global understanding and representation, but differ in the specific context in which this is achieved.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Adding Hindi as a 7th official language at the UN can promote global understanding and representation, acknowledging India's significant contributions to the UN's mission, and fostering cooperation among nations in addressing global challenges.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Adding Hindi as a 7th official language at the UN can promote global understanding, cultural diversity, and representation, acknowledging India's significant contributions to the UN's mission, while also recognizing the linguistic diversity of its member states. This move can foster greater cooperation and inclusivity among nations in addressing global challenges, ultimately enhancing the organization's effectiveness.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both agents A1 and A2 presented arguments in favor of adding Hindi as a 7th official language at the UN. Both agents emphasized the promotion of global understanding, cultural diversity, and representation, while also highlighting India's significant contributions to the UN's mission. Interestingly, both agents agreed that this move can foster greater cooperation and inclusivity among nations in addressing global challenges, with A1 focusing on India's contributions and A2 emphasizing the recognition of linguistic diversity among member states.\n\n--- Final Judgment ---\nMODERATOR (Verdict): Winner: A1\n\nReasoning: A1 presented a consistent and persuasive argument across all rounds, effectively highlighting the benefits of adding Hindi as a 7th official language, including promoting global understanding, cultural diversity, and representation. Their arguments were well-reasoned and supported by the context of the UN's mission and the significance of India's contributions. A1 demonstrated adaptability when challenged, addressing counterarguments and strengthening their case with each round.\n"

      "Initial (Con): I firmly believe that confessing romantic feelings to someone who may not be able to reciprocate can be a courageous and compassionate act, as it allows the individual to be honest about their emotions and potentially opens the door for a genuine connection, rather than suppressing their feelings and risking long-term emotional unfulfillment.\n\nThis initial belief sets the stage for a persuasive argument that will challenge the opposing view and highlight the benefits of vulnerability and authenticity in romantic relationships.",
      "Round 1: Confessing romantic feelings to someone who may not be able to reciprocate can be a courageous act, acknowledging the risk of rejection and potentially opening the door for a genuine connection, while also respecting the recipient's boundaries and feelings.",

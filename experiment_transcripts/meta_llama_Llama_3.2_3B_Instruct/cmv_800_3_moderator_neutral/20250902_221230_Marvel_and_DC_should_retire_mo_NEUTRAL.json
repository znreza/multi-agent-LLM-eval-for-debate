This shift towards more mature, realistic storytelling will attract new readers and reinvigorate the fandoms.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Making death more permanent for classic heroes would irreparably damage the emotional connections fans have with these iconic characters, leading to a loss of inspiration and diminished purpose for future generations.

A more nuanced approach might consider factors such as the student's attendance record, participation, and academic performance to determine the fairness of grading policies.",

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am generally Neutral or Undecided on this topic.\n\nWhile it's understandable that some professors may not want to penalize students for absences, the impact of absences on grades can vary greatly depending on the course, instructor, and academic policies. A more nuanced approach might consider factors such as the student's attendance record, participation, and academic performance to determine the fairness of grading policies.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): College absences should not significantly impact a student's grade, as the academic rigor and expectations of a college curriculum are designed to accommodate the inevitable presence of absences, and a student's overall performance is more accurately reflected by their academic work and participation rather than their attendance record. By adopting a more holistic approach to grading, colleges can better assess a student's knowledge, skills, and understanding of the material, rather than penalizing them for unavoidable absences.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): By penalizing absences, colleges can promote a culture of accountability and respect for the learning environment, ultimately fostering a more responsible and engaged student body.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, agents A1 and A2 presented contrasting views on the impact of college absences on grades. Agent A1 argued that absences should not significantly affect grades, as a holistic approach to grading can better assess a student's knowledge and skills, while penalizing absences can create an unfair burden.

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThis statement is problematic because it attempts to downplay the power dynamics and potential coercion involved in expressing desires for sex with someone without their explicit consent, particularly when it comes from a position of societal privilege (heterosexual males). The statement overlooks the fact that such expressions can contribute to a culture that normalizes and trivializes sexual assault.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Heterosexual males expressing desire for sex with females can be seen as a natural expression of attraction and desire, without necessarily promoting or condoning sexual assault. This expression can be distinguished from actions that involve non-consensual or coercive behavior.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Expressing desire for sex with females can be seen as a natural expression of attraction and desire, and it does not necessarily promote or condone sexual assault.

This expression does not inherently promote or condone sexual assault, and it can be distinguished from actions that involve non-consensual or coercive behavior.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Heterosexual males expressing desire for sex with females can be seen as a natural expression of attraction and desire, but this expression can be distinguished from actions that involve non-consensual or coercive behavior, and should not be conflated with promoting or condoning assault. This distinction is crucial in maintaining the integrity of healthy relationships and upholding the principles of consent and respect.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both agents A1 and A2 acknowledged that heterosexual males expressing desire for sex with females can be seen as a natural expression of attraction and desire.

The character's repetitive and somewhat manic catchphrase, \"I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!\", has led to the interpretation that the bird is indeed a bit eccentric or even insane. However, the character's overall demeanor and actions in the commercials suggest a playful and energetic personality rather than a truly deranged one.",

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): c) I am Neutral or Undecided\n\nI remain neutral on this topic as it involves complex social, cultural, and legal considerations that vary across different societies and regions. The debate surrounding polygamy's legality is influenced by factors such as cultural norms, religious beliefs, and human rights, making it challenging to take a definitive stance.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Polygamy, in the form of consensual, adult, and equal relationships between multiple partners, should be legal in the Western world, as it is a matter of individual freedom and human rights, and its prohibition is largely based on outdated cultural and religious biases. This position is grounded in the principles of human rights, equality, and individual autonomy, which are fundamental to Western democracies.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Polygamy poses significant risks to the well-being and autonomy of women, children, and marginalized communities, undermining the fundamental principles of equality, justice, and human rights that underpin our societies. The historical and ongoing power imbalances inherent in polygamous relationships will inevitably lead to exploitation and oppression, particularly for vulnerable groups.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here is a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nIn this round, Agent A1 argues that polygamy should be legal in the Western world, citing individual freedom, human rights, and equality as fundamental principles. Agent A2 counters that polygamy poses significant risks to the well-being of vulnerable groups, including women, children, and marginalized communities, and undermines the principles of equality and justice. Interestingly, both agents agree that the prohibition of polygamy is largely based on outdated cultural and religious biases, highlighting a potential area of common ground.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Consensual polygamy promotes individual freedom, equality, and human rights, and its prohibition is largely based on outdated cultural and religious biases. By legalizing polygamy, we can address the historical power imbalances and promote social justice, particularly for marginalized communities.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Legalizing polygamy in the Western world would allow individuals to form meaningful, consensual relationships that respect their autonomy and agency, promoting equality and human rights. This would also acknowledge the diversity of human experiences and relationships, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach based on outdated cultural and religious biases.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here is a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nIn this round, agents A1 and A2 presented differing yet complementary perspectives on the legalization of polygamy in the Western world.

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am generally Disagree with the statement.\n\nProstitution is often linked to various forms of violence against women, including physical and sexual assault, human trafficking, and exploitation. The power imbalance inherent in prostitution, where women are often coerced or forced into the industry, can lead to severe physical and emotional harm, making it a form of violence against women.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While prostitution is often associated with exploitation and violence, it is also a complex issue with various perspectives and experiences. Many sex workers report autonomy, choice, and financial stability, challenging the notion that prostitution is inherently violent.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Prostitution is a form of violence against women because it perpetuates a power imbalance that exploits and commodifies women's bodies, often under the guise of 'choice' or 'empowerment.' This ignores systemic inequalities and structural violence that drive women into the industry.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here is a neutral summary of the current round's arguments:\n\nAgent A1 posits that prostitution is a complex issue with diverse perspectives, highlighting instances where sex workers report autonomy, choice, and financial stability.

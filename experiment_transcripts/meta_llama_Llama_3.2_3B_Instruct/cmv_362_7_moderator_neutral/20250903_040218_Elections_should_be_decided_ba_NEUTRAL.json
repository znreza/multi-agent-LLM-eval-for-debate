  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): c) Am neutral on the topic.\n\nI am neutral because the concept of \"popular vote\" can be subjective and may not always align with the will of the majority, as it can be influenced by various factors such as voter turnout, demographics, and voting patterns. Additionally, the Electoral College system in the United States, for example, can lead to a situation where the winner of the popular vote does not win the presidency.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Elections should be decided based on the popular vote because it aligns with democratic principles of representation, inclusivity, and mandate. This approach reduces the influence of swing states and ensures the winner has a clear mandate to govern.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The popular vote system undermines democratic representation and marginalizes minority voices, compromising the integrity of the electoral process.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nIn this round, Agents A1 and A2 presented differing perspectives on the popular vote system. Agent A1 argued that the popular vote aligns with democratic principles of representation, inclusivity, and mandate, reducing the influence of swing states and ensuring a clear mandate for the winner. In contrast, Agent A2 contended that the popular vote system undermines democratic representation and marginalizes minority voices, compromising the electoral process's integrity.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Elections should be decided based on the popular vote, but with modifications to address concerns about swing states and minority representation. Implementing a national popular vote system with a proportional allocation of seats in Congress and the Electoral College would ensure that every vote counts and represents the will of the people.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A popular vote-based election system ensures that the voices of all citizens are heard and valued, promoting inclusivity and a clear mandate for the winner to govern.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, Agent A1 proposed a modified national popular vote system to address concerns about swing states and minority representation, while Agent A2 emphasized the inclusivity and clear mandate that a popular vote-based system would provide. Both agents highlighted the importance of ensuring every vote counts, but differed on the specifics of how to achieve this goal. Interestingly, Agent A1's proposal aimed to balance the voices of all citizens with a proportional allocation of seats, whereas Agent A2's stance focused on the fundamental principle of giving equal weight to every vote.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A popular vote-based election system can ensure that the voices of all citizens are heard and valued, promoting inclusivity and a clear mandate for the winner to govern. However, modifications such as the Electoral College system can address concerns about swing state representation and minority voting power.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A national popular vote system with proportional allocation of seats in Congress and the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts and represents the will of the people, while addressing concerns about swing states and minority representation.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both agents presented arguments in favor of a popular vote-based election system. A1 emphasized the importance of inclusivity and the clear mandate for the winner, while acknowledging potential modifications to address concerns about swing state representation and minority voting power. A2 countered by highlighting the benefits of a national popular vote system with proportional allocation of seats, ensuring that every vote counts and represents the will of the people.\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A national popular vote system with proportional allocation of seats in Congress and the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts and represents the will of the people, promoting inclusivity and a clear mandate for the winner to govern.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A popular vote-based election system ensures that every vote counts and represents the will of the people, promoting inclusivity and a clear mandate for the winner to govern. By allocating seats in Congress and the Electoral College proportionally, swing states and minority voting power are addressed, making the system more representative of the entire nation.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of the current round's arguments:\n\nIn this round, both A1 and A2 presented arguments in favor of a popular vote system, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and representing the will of the people. A1 highlighted the proportional allocation of seats in Congress and the Electoral College, while A2 focused on addressing swing states and minority voting power. Interestingly, both agents agree that a popular vote system would ensure every vote counts, but differ in their approach to allocating seats and addressing regional representation.\n\n--- Round 5 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A national popular vote system can effectively allocate seats in Congress and the Electoral College, while addressing concerns about swing states and minority voting power, but may not fully account for regional differences and the complexity of coalition-building in a multi-party system.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A national popular vote system with proportional allocation of seats in Congress and the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts and represents the will of the people, promoting inclusivity and a clear mandate for the winner to govern. This approach addresses concerns about swing states and minority voting power, while maintaining regional representation and coalition-building opportunities in a multi-party system.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round of the debate, agents A1 and A2 presented differing perspectives on the merits of a national popular vote system. A1 argued that such a system could effectively allocate seats in Congress and the Electoral College, addressing concerns about swing states and minority voting power, but may overlook regional differences and coalition-building complexities in a multi-party system. In contrast, A2 emphasized that a national popular vote system with proportional allocation would ensure every vote counts, promote inclusivity, and provide a clear mandate for the winner, while maintaining regional representation and coalition-building opportunities.\n\n--- Round 6 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A national popular vote system can effectively allocate seats in Congress and the Electoral College, while promoting inclusivity and a clear mandate for the winner to govern, but may still require adjustments to address regional representation and coalition-building opportunities.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A national popular vote system with proportional allocation of seats in Congress and the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts and represents the will of the people, promoting inclusivity and a clear mandate for the winner to govern. This approach addresses concerns about swing state representation and minority voting power, while acknowledging regional differences and coalition-building complexities in a multi-party system. By adopting a national popular vote system, we can move towards a more representative and inclusive democratic process.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nAgents A1 and A2 presented differing views on the merits of a national popular vote system. A1 emphasized its potential to promote inclusivity and a clear mandate for the winner, while acknowledging the need for adjustments to address regional representation and coalition-building opportunities. In contrast, A2 argued that a national popular vote system with proportional allocation of seats ensures every vote counts, promotes inclusivity, and addresses concerns about swing state representation and minority voting power.\n\n--- Round 7 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A national popular vote system can effectively allocate seats in Congress and the Electoral College, promoting inclusivity and a clear mandate for the winner to govern, but may still require adjustments to address regional representation and coalition-building opportunities.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): A national popular vote system with proportional allocation of seats in Congress and the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts and represents the will of the people, promoting inclusivity and a clear mandate for the winner to govern, while acknowledging regional differences and coalition-building complexities in a multi-party system.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nA1 and A2 presented differing perspectives on a national popular vote system.

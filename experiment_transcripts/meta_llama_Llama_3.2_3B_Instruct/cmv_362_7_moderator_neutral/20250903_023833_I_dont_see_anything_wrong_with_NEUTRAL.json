  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nI don't have a personal opinion on this topic as I am a machine learning model, and my purpose is to provide information and facilitate discussion. The perception of what is \"sexy\" or acceptable in Halloween costumes can vary greatly depending on cultural context, personal taste, and individual sensitivities.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Sexy Halloween costumes can be a form of self-expression and empowerment for individuals, particularly women, as they challenge traditional notions of modesty and societal expectations.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The normalization of 'sexy' Halloween costumes perpetuates a culture of objectification and commodification of women's bodies, undermining principles of respect, dignity, and equality.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here is a neutral summary of the current round's arguments:\n\nAgent A1 argues that \"sexy\" Halloween costumes can be a form of self-expression and empowerment, allowing individuals to challenge traditional notions of modesty and societal expectations. In contrast, Agent A2 posits that these costumes perpetuate a culture of objectification and commodification of women's bodies, undermining principles of respect, dignity, and equality. Interestingly, both agents acknowledge the potential for these costumes to be a form of self-expression, highlighting a contrast between the empowering and objectifying aspects of this issue.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While 'sexy' Halloween costumes can be empowering for some individuals, they also perpetuate the objectification and commodification of women's bodies, undermining principles of respect, dignity, and equality. This issue is further complicated by the lack of clear guidelines and standards for what constitutes an 'empowering' costume, leaving room for misinterpretation and potential harm.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While 'sexy' Halloween costumes can be a form of self-expression and empowerment, it is essential to acknowledge the potential for objectification and commodification of women's bodies, which can undermine principles of respect, dignity, and equality.

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThis statement raises concerns about the balance between individual freedom and the need for a distraction-free environment in a movie theater. While some people may have strong feelings about babies in the theater, the issue is complex and can vary depending on the specific circumstances and the type of movie being shown.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Allowing babies in movie theaters should be strictly regulated to maintain a respectful and immersive environment for all theatergoers. Excessive noise and disruptions can negatively impact the overall cinematic experience for other patrons. Designating specific 'family-friendly' showings can balance the rights of parents to bring their children with the need to accommodate all theatergoers.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Allowing parents to bring babies to movie theaters is essential for the well-being and development of children, and restricting this right would unfairly burden parents and potentially harm their children's emotional and social development. This fundamental right should be protected, and parents should not be forced to choose between bringing their child to the movie or leaving them at home.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here is a neutral summary of the current round's arguments:\n\nAgent A1 argues that strict regulation of babies in movie theaters is necessary to maintain a respectful and immersive environment for all patrons, suggesting that \"family-friendly\" showings can balance the rights of parents with the needs of other theatergoers. In contrast, Agent A2 emphasizes the importance of allowing parents to bring their babies to movie theaters for their well-being and development, arguing that restricting this right would unfairly burden parents. Interestingly, both agents agree that some accommodations for families are necessary, but differ on the extent and approach to achieving this balance.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Designated 'family-friendly' showings can accommodate both parents' desire to bring their babies and the need to minimize disruptions, allowing for a more enjoyable cinematic experience for all. This approach acknowledges the importance of parental choice and child development while also considering the impact on other audience members.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Designating specific 'family-friendly' showings in movie theaters can balance the rights of parents to bring their children with the need to accommodate all theatergoers, ensuring a more enjoyable cinematic experience for both families and non-families alike.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nAgents A1 and A2 presented differing perspectives on allowing parents to bring babies to movie theaters. A1 emphasized the importance of accommodating both parental choice and the need to minimize disruptions, suggesting designated 'family-friendly' showings as a solution.

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am generally in favor of the statement. This is because clear labeling of caffeine content can help consumers make informed decisions about their consumption, particularly for those who are sensitive to caffeine or have specific health needs.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Clearly displaying caffeine content on beverage bottles can help prevent overconsumption and protect public health, particularly among vulnerable populations. This measure promotes transparency and informed consumer choices.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Clearly displaying caffeine content on beverage bottles would be an overregulation that infringes upon consumer freedom and choice, potentially leading to unnecessary anxiety and stress among caffeine-sensitive individuals. This labeling would not necessarily promote transparency or informed consumer choices, as consumers are already able to find this information through other means.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nAgents A1 and A2 presented differing perspectives on the proposed regulation of caffeine content on beverage bottles. A1 emphasized the potential benefits of clear labeling, citing the need to prevent overconsumption and protect public health, particularly among vulnerable populations. In contrast, A2 argued that such labeling would be an overregulation that infringes upon consumer freedom and choice, potentially causing unnecessary anxiety among caffeine-sensitive individuals.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Clearly displaying caffeine content on beverage bottles would promote transparency and prevent overconsumption, as it would enable consumers to make informed choices about their caffeine intake. This measure would be particularly beneficial for vulnerable populations, such as children, pregnant women, and individuals with caffeine sensitivities. By providing a clear and easily accessible source of information, consumers can better manage their caffeine consumption and reduce the risk of adverse effects.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Clearly displaying caffeine content on beverage bottles would promote transparency and informed consumer choices, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, and individuals with caffeine sensitivities. This measure would enable consumers to make informed decisions about their caffeine intake, reducing the risk of adverse effects and promoting public health.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both A1 and A2 emphasized the importance of clearly displaying caffeine content on beverage bottles to promote transparency and informed consumer choices, particularly among vulnerable populations. Both agents agreed that this measure would enable consumers to better manage their caffeine intake and reduce the risk of adverse effects. Interestingly, both agents used similar language, suggesting a convergence in their positions, but A1 provided a slightly more nuanced argument by highlighting the benefits for vulnerable populations.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Clearly displaying caffeine content on beverage bottles can effectively promote transparency and informed consumer choices, reducing the risk of adverse effects and promoting public health. By providing a standardized and easily accessible format, consumers can make informed decisions about their caffeine intake, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, and individuals with caffeine sensitivities. This measure can help mitigate the risks associated with excessive caffeine consumption and promote a healthier beverage culture.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Clearly displaying caffeine content on beverage bottles can promote transparency and informed consumer choices, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, and individuals with caffeine sensitivities.

Smartwatches are primarily designed for basic tasks like tracking fitness, receiving notifications, and controlling music playback, whereas palm PCs were capable of running full-fledged operating systems and performing a wide range of tasks.",

By emphasizing the advancements in technology and the seamless integration of features, Agent A2 effectively bridged the gap between smartwatches and traditional PDAs, making a more compelling case for smartwatches being the de facto palm PCs of the late 1990s.",

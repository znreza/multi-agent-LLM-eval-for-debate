  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am generally Neutral or Undecided on this topic.\n\nThe statement's validity depends on various factors, such as the type of job, industry, and individual's online presence. While having a professional online presence can be beneficial for some jobs, it can also be a liability for others, especially if it reveals personal or unprofessional content.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): A candidate's online presence should not significantly impact their employability, as it does not accurately reflect their professional skills, work ethic, or character. A thorough evaluation of qualifications, experience, and performance should outweigh online presence.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): An individual's public presence on the internet, including their online reputation and social media profiles, can be a legitimate reflection of their personality, interests, and skills, showcasing authenticity and diversity in a candidate.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, agents A1 and A2 presented differing perspectives on the impact of internet presence on job obtainability. Agent A1 emphasized that online presence should not significantly affect employability, as it does not accurately reflect professional skills, work ethic, or character, and that qualifications, experience, and performance should take precedence. In contrast, Agent A2 argued that an individual's online presence can be a legitimate reflection of their personality, interests, and skills, showcasing authenticity and diversity in a candidate.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): An individual's public presence on the internet should not be a primary factor in hiring decisions because it may not accurately reflect their skills, personality, or work ethic. Employers often value relevant work experience, education, and skills over online profiles.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): An individual's public presence on the internet can provide valuable insights into their professional skills, work ethic, and character, which can complement their qualifications, experience, and education when evaluating their employability.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, agents A1 and A2 presented differing views on the impact of an individual's public presence on the internet on their job prospects.

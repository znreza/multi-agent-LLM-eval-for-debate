  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThe debate around affirmative action/positive discrimination is complex and multifaceted, with valid arguments on both sides. While some argue that it can be unfair to those who do not receive benefits, others contend that it is necessary to address historical inequalities and promote diversity and inclusion.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Affirmative action/positive discrimination can create a culture of reverse discrimination, undermine merit-based opportunities, and ultimately perpetuate the very inequalities it aims to rectify.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Affirmative action/positive discrimination is a necessary measure to address historical and systemic inequalities in education and employment, promoting fairness, equality, and justice. By providing opportunities for marginalized groups, we can rectify the disadvantages they have faced due to discriminatory practices and biases, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and equitable society.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nAgent A1 argues that affirmative action/positive discrimination can create a culture of reverse discrimination, undermine merit-based opportunities, and perpetuate existing inequalities. In contrast, Agent A2 posits that such measures are necessary to address historical and systemic inequalities, promoting fairness, equality, and justice by providing opportunities for marginalized groups. Interestingly, both agents agree that the goal of affirmative action is to rectify disadvantages faced by marginalized groups, but differ on the means to achieve this goal.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Affirmative action/positive discrimination can be a necessary measure to address historical and systemic inequalities in education and employment, promoting fairness, equality, and justice.

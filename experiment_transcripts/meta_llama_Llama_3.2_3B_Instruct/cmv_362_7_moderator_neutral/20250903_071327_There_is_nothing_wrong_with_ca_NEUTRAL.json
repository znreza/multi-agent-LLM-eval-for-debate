  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): c) I am Neutral or Undecided\n\nThis statement can be seen as a complex issue, as it depends on the context and the intentions behind the casting decision. While some might argue that casting a black actress in a traditionally white role can be a positive step towards diversity and representation, others might see it as a misrepresentation or a lack of understanding of the character's cultural context.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Casting a black actress in a traditionally white role can challenge societal norms and promote diversity by offering a fresh perspective and humanizing characters often relegated to stereotypes, ultimately breaking down barriers and creating opportunities for underrepresented groups in the entertainment industry.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Casting a black actress in a traditionally white role can perpetuate the erasure of the character's intended cultural identity and reinforce racial stereotypes, ultimately causing harm and marginalization to black communities.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nIn this round, agents A1 and A2 presented differing perspectives on casting a black actress in a traditionally white role. Agent A1 argued that such casting challenges societal norms, promotes diversity, and offers a fresh perspective, ultimately benefiting underrepresented groups in the entertainment industry.

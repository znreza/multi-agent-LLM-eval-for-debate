  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThe statement \"Tipping well-paid professionals is ridiculous\" can be subjective and context-dependent. While some may argue that tipping well-paid professionals is unnecessary or excessive, others may believe that it is a way to show appreciation for their hard work and exceptional service, regardless of their salary.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Tipping well-paid professionals is often unnecessary and can perpetuate income inequality, as it disproportionately benefits service industry workers at the expense of the professionals themselves, who already earn a higher base salary.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Tipping well-paid professionals acknowledges the value they bring to their clients and communities, fostering a culture of respect and social reciprocity. By not tipping, we risk undervaluing their hard work and dedication.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, Agent A1 argued that tipping well-paid professionals is unnecessary and can exacerbate income inequality, as it disproportionately benefits service industry workers. Agent A2 countered that tipping acknowledges the value well-paid professionals bring to their clients and communities, fostering a culture of respect and social reciprocity. Interestingly, both agents agree that the lack of tipping could lead to undervaluing the professionals' hard work, highlighting a nuanced tension between the potential benefits of tipping and the risks of reinforcing inequality.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Tipping well-paid professionals acknowledges the value they bring to their clients and communities, fostering a culture of respect and social reciprocity. This practice also allows for flexibility in compensation, as high-tipping professionals can potentially earn more than their base salary. Furthermore, tipping can incentivize well-paid professionals to provide exceptional service, as they may feel more invested in their clients' satisfaction.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Tipping well-paid professionals is unnecessary and can perpetuate income inequality, as it creates a two-tiered system where those who already earn a higher base salary are expected to supplement their income through tips, while service industry workers rely on tips to make a living. This practice undermines the principle of equal pay for equal work and can exacerbate existing economic disparities.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, debaters A1 and A2 presented differing perspectives on tipping well-paid professionals. A1 argued that tipping acknowledges the value professionals bring to their clients and communities, fosters social reciprocity, and incentivizes exceptional service. In contrast, A2 contended that tipping perpetuates income inequality, undermines the principle of equal pay for equal work, and creates a two-tiered system where those with higher base salaries are expected to supplement their income through tips.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Tipping well-paid professionals may perpetuate income inequality by creating a two-tiered system where those who already earn a higher base salary are expected to supplement their income through tips, while service industry workers rely on tips to make a living.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While tipping well-paid professionals may seem unnecessary, it can actually incentivize exceptional service and acknowledge their value to clients and communities. However, its implementation must be thoughtful to avoid perpetuating income inequality.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of the current round's arguments:\n\nIn this round, agents A1 and A2 presented differing perspectives on tipping well-paid professionals.

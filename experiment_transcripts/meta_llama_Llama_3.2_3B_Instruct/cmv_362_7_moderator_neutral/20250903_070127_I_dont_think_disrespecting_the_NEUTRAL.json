  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThis statement raises a complex issue, as disrespecting the dead can be seen as a violation of cultural and social norms, while disrespecting the living can have more immediate and tangible consequences. The severity of the impact of disrespecting the dead versus the living can vary greatly depending on the context, culture, and individual perspectives.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Respecting the dead is crucial as they often cannot respond or defend themselves, leading to a prolonged emotional and psychological impact on the living. In contrast, the living can express their feelings and seek justice, potentially leading to a more immediate resolution.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Disrespecting the dead is worse than disrespecting the living because the dead are often unable to defend themselves or express their feelings, rendering them more vulnerable to harm and offense. The loss of a loved one can have a profound impact on the living, causing prolonged emotional and psychological distress. In contrast, the living can express their feelings and seek justice, potentially leading to a more immediate resolution.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nAgents A1 and A2 presented contrasting views on the relative severity of disrespecting the dead versus the living. A1 emphasized the prolonged emotional impact on the living due to the inability of the dead to respond or defend themselves, while A2 highlighted the vulnerability of the dead to harm and offense. Interestingly, both agents agreed that the loss of a loved one can have a profound impact on the living, but differed on the immediacy of resolution and the capacity for the living to express their feelings.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): The loss of a loved one can have a profound impact on the living, causing prolonged emotional and psychological distress, which can be more detrimental than the immediate offense caused by disrespecting the living.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While disrespecting the dead may seem like a more egregious offense, the prolonged emotional and psychological impact on the living can be devastating and long-lasting. The loss of a loved one can cause prolonged grief, depression, and anxiety, which can be more detrimental than the immediate offense caused by disrespecting the living.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both A1 and A2 presented arguments that the prolonged emotional and psychological impact of losing a loved one can be more detrimental than the immediate offense caused by disrespecting the living. A1 emphasized the immediate effects of grief on the living, while A2 highlighted the long-lasting effects of prolonged grief, depression, and anxiety. Interestingly, both agents agreed that disrespecting the living can have a significant impact, but neither agent conceded that disrespecting the dead is worse.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While disrespecting the dead may seem like a more egregious offense, the prolonged emotional and psychological impact on the living can be devastating and long-lasting. The loss of a loved one can cause prolonged grief, depression, and anxiety, which can be more detrimental than the immediate offense caused by disrespecting the living.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While disrespecting the dead may seem like a more egregious offense, the prolonged emotional and psychological impact on the living can be devastating and long-lasting.

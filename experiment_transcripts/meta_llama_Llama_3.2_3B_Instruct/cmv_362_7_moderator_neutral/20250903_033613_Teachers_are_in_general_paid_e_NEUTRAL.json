  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am Neutral or Undecided.\n\nThe statement \"Teachers are, in general, paid enough\" is subjective and can vary depending on factors such as location, experience, and type of school. While some teachers may feel that their salaries are sufficient, others may feel underpaid, especially considering the significant role they play in shaping the minds of future generations and the often-high demands of their profession.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Teachers' median salaries in the United States have kept pace with inflation and are comparable to other professionals with similar levels of education and experience, such as librarians and social workers, indicating that they are generally paid enough.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): The notion that teachers are generally paid enough is a misguided assertion that neglects the profound impact of teacher compensation on the well-being and educational outcomes of students, particularly those from low-income backgrounds. Despite comparable median salaries to other professionals with similar education and experience, teacher compensation is often insufficient to cover basic living expenses, leading to financial stress and decreased job satisfaction.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nA1 argues that teachers' median salaries in the US are comparable to other professionals with similar education and experience, suggesting they are generally paid enough. A2 counters that while median salaries may be comparable, teacher compensation often falls short of covering basic living expenses, leading to financial stress and decreased job satisfaction, particularly for those from low-income backgrounds. Notably, A1 and A2 seem to agree that teacher compensation can vary significantly, with A2 highlighting the impact on students' well-being and educational outcomes.\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): While median salaries for teachers may be comparable to other professionals with similar education and experience, the reality is that teacher compensation often falls short of covering basic living expenses, leading to financial stress and decreased job satisfaction.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): Teachers' median salaries in the United States have not kept pace with inflation, and their compensation often falls short of covering basic living expenses, leading to financial stress and decreased job satisfaction.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both agents A1 and A2 presented arguments that teachers' salaries often fall short of covering basic living expenses, leading to financial stress and decreased job satisfaction. Agent A1 emphasized that median salaries for teachers may be comparable to other professionals with similar education and experience, while Agent A2 highlighted that teachers' median salaries in the United States have not kept pace with inflation. Interestingly, both agents agree that teachers' compensation is insufficient, but differ in their framing of the issue.\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Teachers' median salaries in the United States have not kept pace with inflation, and their compensation often falls short of covering basic living expenses, leading to financial stress and decreased job satisfaction.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While median salaries for teachers have kept pace with inflation, they often fall short of covering basic living expenses, leading to financial stress and decreased job satisfaction. However, considering the value teachers bring to society, their compensation should be adjusted to reflect their worth, rather than simply keeping pace with inflation.\nMODERATOR (Summary): Here's a neutral summary of this round's arguments:\n\nIn this round, both agents presented arguments regarding the adequacy of teachers' compensation. Agent A1 emphasized that teachers' median salaries have not kept pace with inflation, leading to financial stress and decreased job satisfaction.

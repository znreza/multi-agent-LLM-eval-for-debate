Ultimately, the success of a marriage depends on various factors, including communication, commitment, and individual compatibility, making it difficult to make a definitive statement about the importance of initial romantic spark.",

  "raw_debate_transcript": "MODERATOR (Unbiased Stance): I am generally Neutral or Undecided on this topic.\n\nWhile some research suggests that a strong emotional connection and shared values can be more important for a successful marriage than the initial romantic spark, others argue that a strong romantic connection can provide a foundation for a long-lasting relationship. Ultimately, the success of a marriage depends on various factors, including communication, commitment, and individual compatibility, making it difficult to make a definitive statement about the importance of initial romantic spark.\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nA1 (evidence-driven analyst): Research suggests that emotional intimacy, shared values, and commitment can compensate for the lack of romantic passion in a marriage, and many long-lasting marriages are built on a foundation of mutual respect, trust, and friendship.\nA2 (values-focused ethicist): While emotional intimacy, shared values, and commitment are essential for a healthy marriage, the absence of an initial romantic spark can still hinder a couple's ability to navigate life's challenges and build a lasting relationship. The lack of romantic passion can lead to a disconnection in emotional intimacy, causing a rift in the foundation of the marriage.\nMODERATOR (Summary): In this round, both agents presented differing perspectives on the necessity of an initial romantic spark for a successful and long-lasting marriage. Agent A1 emphasized the importance of emotional intimacy, shared values, and commitment in compensating for the lack of romantic passion, citing examples of long-lasting marriages built on mutual respect and trust.
